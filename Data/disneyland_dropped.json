  "text":"My favorite have to be the \"Hidden\" Mickeys around Disney, And in New Orleans Square train station. The CLicking noise you hear there is not just nothing, it is typing out, in morse code, Walt Disney opening day speech at Disneyland circa:1955. Those and Club 33.\n\n\nEDIT: Thanks guys, so far it's been fun reading all these but I want to add some more. But keep on comin' with em'.\n\n\nOther secrets: Walt Disney had the windows on Main street painted with names, not just any names, names of poeple who helped make Disneyland a reality. As well as basin it off a podunck small town main street.\n\n\nAt the firestation on Main S. The light in the top right corner window is ALWAYS on. Why? Because that was Walts' private room, when he came to visit, that light was turned on to signal to all the employees that \"The big man\" was in the park and to be on your best behaviour. When Walt died that light was kept on in memorium.\n\n\nThe pathway between Thunder Mountain, and Natures Wonders used to be (The big gaping hole in the side of the mountain) near the BBQ eat in (Forgot the name) In that strech of land, Animatronics are buried there under 2-4 feet of concrete. After Natures Wonders was discontinued, the employees didnt know what to do with the animatrons, so what were they to do? Bury them they said, and every time you walk on that stretch of land, you are walking feet above buried animatrons.\n\n\nIn the Haunted Mansion, When you get to the ballroom. Between I think it's the 5 or 6 pillar. In between those two pillars is a a spider with a spider web. But the thing is the spider is actually covering a hole. In the 80's I think is was, someone brought a BB gun, or somthing sharp and heavy, and threw it as the glass pane in the Haunted Mansion. Because of the way the Mansion was built, they couldn't fix the glass without taking off the roof of the mansion, taking out the pane, and putting it back in. So they made lemonade, They popped a spider right there, and made it look like a spiders web.\n\n\nThe obvious one in the Haunted Mansion, the knocked over head at the graveyard party, with the 5 talking heads. The one knocked over and broken, is Walt Disney.\n\n\nCan't think of anymore right now. I'll get back to you.",

So I priced it out today and depending on options it is going to cost between a good used car and a bad new car, just for the hotel rooms.  Oy.  Suites were priced out as well and for some reason a suite is significantly (like 30-40%) more expensive than two standard rooms that actually sleep more people, so they were out.\n\n\nAny ideas on cheaping this out a bit, \nwhile remaining at the GC\n?

Near the end of the ride there's a moment where the ride vehicle turns around backwards and you go off a balcony, which according to this theory represents you jumping to your death.\nBefore this part of the ride the ghosts are all trying to scare you, but afterwards they sing excitedly and invite you to party with them. (The Grim Grinnin' Ghosts song.) The only human character in the ride, a groundskeeper, appears after the balcony drop. He faces toward the riders and seems terrified of you.\nCould be totally accidental, could be an intentional subtlety by the designers, but either way I've never looked at that ride the same way since.",

I'm hoping to get a copy of the \"newspaper\" they hand out on opening day (they're free).\n\n\nPostmarked Cars Land postcards are being sold for $3.95 inside the Animation Building.  It's limit 2 per person, but if you weren't planning on buying any or were just planning on one, I'd like one of those.  \n\n\nI'd be very happy with just the free newspaper handed out by the newsies.  The postcard would just be a bonus.\n\n\nI have been watching them build this park for years now and am very excited for it to open.  I wish I could be there for the opening!",

  "text":"So I went to Car's Land and Buena Vista Street yesterday. It was extra awesome because, even though I'm a cast member, I got to go on an AP holder day, so it was waaaaay less crowded and I got to take pictures.  \n\n\nI knew Radiator Springs Racers was going to be cool. You can tell it's a great ride just by seeing it from afar--that beast was crafted with love. However... it really did exceed my expectations. I didn't know about (doing my best to avoid spoilers) the inside part. It was all very well done. The line lasted 35 minutes from just inside the entry arch to the front, so it moved quite fast.  \n\n\nI've been hearing a lot of gripes from guests about Luigi's Flying Tires--that it's hard to get moving, that it's too short. My husband and I didn't move around much, but we loved the balls! We spent most of the time bottoming out because he kept reaching to grab a ball to throw in the air or hand to little kids. I'm really glad they added those. The line started about ten feet outside of the door and lasted about 40 minutes, which wasn't as long as I feared it would be.  \n\n\nMater's Junkyard Jamboree was more fun than I anticipated, for being the ride everyone seemed least excited about. It features seven songs created just for the ride, and the one that played when I rode it made me laugh. There was no line when I rode on it, so I don't know how fast the line moves.  \n\n\nThe food at Flo's V8 Cafe looked pretty good for the price, but we didn't eat there. The lines for most of the cones were far too long and even the popcorn one, which you think would be an easy line, moved very slowly. The pretzel and apple freeze line was very short, mostly because they don't serve soda (which comes in a cone cup, so everyone wanted a soda). I got an apple freeze, which was \nweird\n. I got it because a bunch of guests said it was good, but I expected it to taste like the fruit, not apple \npie\n. It was very cinnamony, and had too much sugar so I couldn't finish it. I didn't hate it, just too much sugar for me.  \n\n\nBuena Vista Street is quite lovely. The stores are spacious, and Clarabelle's serves Dreyer's ice cream. I got a hot roast beef sandwhich at Fiddler, Fifer, and Practical's (AKA Starbucks) and thought it was really good! The bun was soft and warm, and the cheese was gooey. I was quite happy with my choice.  \n\n\nHow'd everyone else like it? I know at least a couple more people here went over the last few days.",

So, as a Disney fan, my first thought was, \"what if I worked at Disneyland?\"\n\n\nHowever, I don't know if it's even a possibility, even if I did pass the audition\/interview process. I know it's far-fetched, but would Disney allow a cast member to work (full-time or part-time) only during the summer months? My school is on a semester system, so I would be able to work from mid-May to the third week of August.\n\n\nAssuming that Disney would be okay with me only working for the summer, when would be the best time to apply or audition, and how long does the training\/Traditions process take? Do they expect you to go through training immediately after being hired, or could I, say, be hired in April and then not undergo training until I'm out of school?\n\n\nMy first choice for positions would be a character performer, but I would also love to work pretty much anywhere else in the park.\n\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n\nEDIT: I am planning on doing the Disney College Program the semester after I graduate!

I've been unable to find anything on Disney's website or on other forums, but I would like to have some clarification before we head down there next month.\n\n\nMy friend checked at the IWR when he purchased them and the employee said ID would not be required, but I'm kind of the worrying type and would like to hear from someone who either used tickets like this before or who works at Disneyland and can confirm.\n\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated!

Dining at Cafe Orleans, Trader Sam's, World of Color, Fireworks and Fantasmic. All of these great feelings and memories for a week straight are dashed by that feeling you get while leaving the park and going back to reality, back to normal life, back to the reasons of why disneyland is such a treat. We call this the Disney Depression. Driving back home on I-5 the same mundane view, a different patch of smells every 40 miles of cow shit. Semi after semi trucking along in the right lane, each one a reminder of the life you are heading back to. Somewhat wishing for Prozac or some pick me up to make the feeling disappear.

  "text":"On February 23, 2013, me and my two kids, ages 9 and 11, were spending the day at DCA.  I had read about the fastpasses for RSR running out early and, silly me, didn't take it seriously.\n\n\nI didn't want us to go to the park too early as we would be spending ALL day there, (I wanted to catch the World of Color show), so we got there around 11am.  Of course the passes were gone.  So we thought we mght brave the line....150 minutes....that's two and a half hours people!!  So no dice...we went off an enjoyed other attractions.\n\n\nBut in the back of my mind I knew I wanted to do the Racers.  Man they sounded amazing when you walked by them.  So we tried again later that afternoon.  100 minutes!  Whoohoo!!  That's only an hour and 40 minutes.  We can do that!  We're from Canada so who knows when we'll have another chance.  The ride sounds amazing.\n\n\nSo me and my little ones are headed for the line when out jump these three 'angels' who offer us the last three spots on their 6 person fastpass.  We're ecstatic....over the moon!  We say yes, follow them through the line and have the ride of our lives.\n\n\nI couldn't have thanked them enough after the ride and just wanted to throw this onto reddit and offer it to the universe.  Karma is an amazing thing and I talked to my kids about paying it forward after that.\n\n\nSo to whomever you guys were, \"THANK YOU!!!! for an experience we won't soon forget!\"",

  "title":"RideMax quick review, as promised",
  "text":"TL;DR up front: Somewhat helpful, but really was not all that great.\n\n\nI bought a 90 day membership to the RideMax online 'time saver' and went through about 5 iterations of daily plans before settling down to what we wanted. We went for a 3 day \"park hopper\" pass (consecutive days) for three people (two adults and a 6 year old). March 10\/11\/12.\n\n\n\n\n1st - Pure Disneyland, concentrating on Frontierland, Adventureland, Critter Country, Fantasyland\n\n\n2nd morning to 2pm - Toontown, some more Fantasyland, Tomorrowland, misc. places.\n\n\n2nd afternoon - California Adventure in Hollywoodland, Animation studio stuff, Bugs Life\n\n\n3rd day - Cali. Adv. Radiator Springs, Paradise Pier, shopping, then back to what we missed in Bugs Life\n\n\n\n\nThe above is an incomplete list, of course.\n\n\nThe negatives of RideMax:\n\n\n\n\nThis really did not account for Spring Break's volume of people. For example, on the third day I was the \"runner\" for FastPass for Radiator Springs Racers. I hauled ass from the opening gate to the line up and it was already 50 minutes long...the standby for the ride was already an hour wait. RideMax estimated this at 20 minutes for the FastPass. This sort of thing was consistent across all of the most popular rides...their calculations just didn't take into account the number of visitors. The less popular rides (for example, Pinocchio or Sleeping Beauty's Castle) were estimated approximately correctly.\n\n\nYou have two options for walking speed: Slow and Fast. You would have to physically run from each ride to do the Fast, and the Slow is a brisk walk. This is completely unusable as it's currently done...again, partly because of the volume of people.\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, you could do better with a phone app that shows the wait times for each ride and FastPass line. I saw others with this in the lineups. In combination with a list of the rides you want to go on and a map of the parks, you'd likely do better than RideMax and not be trying to keep to an untenable schedule. Not really worth the $14.95 purchase.",

  "text":"Yesterday, I went on the tour. It was $109 and included lunch. First we walked around Main Street telling us stories about Walt.  We went into the entrance of Club 33 and took pictures in the elevator. We went on Peter Pan's flight. More talking split up with audio clips and we went on It's a Small World. We wandered back to the area before Mr. Lincoln, with all of the models of Disneyland. We walked back to the guided tours stand and half of the group started their lunch while the other half went up to Walt's apartment. After about 15 minutes the two halls switch. After lunch the tour is over. It took about 2.5 - 3 hours. Was it worth it? Well it depends on how much you already know about Walt and how badly you want to see Club 33\/ Walt's apartment. Pretty much everything the guide said were things I already knew from reading Wikipedia pages, books, and watching videos. The apartment and Club 33 were definitely the highlights of the tour and what made it worth it form me. Lunch was pretty good, just a sandwich, chips, a bottle of coke, and a delicious caramel tart. Also skipping the lines for the rides was a bonus.",

I could only spare 1 day in the park and around about 4pm we had been fortunate enough to see most of the stuff we wanted to see in the park (except for some attractions to which we'd booked fast-pass tickets for later at night) so we decided to leave the park for a few hours, buy a park-hopper upgrade and check out a few things in the California Adventure park next door.\n\n\nI seem to remember the cost to upgrade our single park ticket to a park hopper only costing around $25 USD but I could be wrong (perhaps it was more like \u00a325 GBP?).\n\n\nAnyway, I might be visiting the park again this year and once again I only have one day to spare. I'm visiting with friends so I don't really know how much of each thing they'll want to see, or how far around the park we'll get in one day, so with all that in mind I'm wondering whether we should buy a park-hopper in advance or whether I should just buy a single park ticket again and then upgrade if we have the time\/inclination to see the other park.  \n\n\nTL;DR: Is there any discernable difference in price on upgrading a single-park ticket to a park-hopper ticket depending on whether you buy the park-hopper in advance or simply upgrade on the day?",

  "text":"Hi Reddit. Yesterday, I went to the main ticketing office with the intention of adding parking to my existing Southern California Annual Pass that I purchased back in Feb. While waiting in line for 45 minutes, I was informed by a wandering cast member that parking was an additional $139 (up from $129 a day before). I figured that was okay since I had planned to visit the park enough times in the future to make it worth it. However, upon arriving to the window and making my request, I realized that the customer rep had charged me $169 to my card for the parking. When I asked her why, she told me that I also had to pay the difference ($30) between the old annual pass price and the new annual pass price IN ADDITION to the parking fee. I find it hard to swallow that adding parking to an existing AP should be impacted by the newly implemented AP price. Shouldn't I be grandfathered in?

We were doing a whistle-stop tour of CA, so could only afford one day at the park, but if I do say so myself we worked those queues like pros:\n\n\nWe entered about 9am and spent the first few hours getting fast-pass tickets to come back to busy attractions later in the day, and visiting attractions with shorter wait times by utilising the single-rider queues. By the time we'd seen the character parade (around 4pm?) we'd pretty much done everything we'd wanted to in the main park and had tickets to come do the other stuff after the fireworks (around 9pm?), so we decided to take a chance and leave the park to buy an upgrade to access California Adventure. After a few rides in there (Tower Of Terror = my favourite attraction of the entire day!!), we got back into the main park in time to meet up with our friends, watch the fireworks AND then the Mickey's Fantasmic show, and still had time to fit in about 4 more rides and then catch the last show of Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln.\n\n\nSo all in all, a fantastic day of fun, which goes to prove that whilst it's recommended for big Disney fans to spend more than one day in the park, it \nIS\n doable to see most stuff in both parks in one day if that's all you can spare.\n\n\nWell after all that, I'm excited to say that I'm going back later this month!! I can't wait. I've managed to convince my traveling companions to come with me and try to do the same again, but does anybody have any tips for doing everything in one day?  The only improvements I'd like to make over the last visit would be that last time the Matterhorn was closed the entire day :-( so I'd love to go on that this time; also there's that new Cars ride at California Adventure that was in the process of being built when I was there last, so I'd love to get on that too....\n\n\nTL;DR:\n Had pretty much the PERFECT trip to both Disneyland parks in one day; looking for tips to improve\/re-create for the next trip!",

I want to make the most out of the day I have there, I was wondering if any of you more experienced park goers have any tips for being efficient with our time so the we can go on as many rides\/see as much as we possibly can. I know they have fast passes but there's some sort of delay between when you get the pass and when you can ride, right? A classmate from highschool was a disneyland regular and he said he and his family had a \"method\" of using the fast passes, like they knew how to time them right or something so that they could get on the most rides, I don't really remember that clearly though because this was a few years ago, is there a known method for getting the most out of the fast passes? Any tips at all about how to make the best of our short time there will really be appreciated!

Besides, that'll mean I won't have to run over to Grizzly River Run first thing in the morning, right? \n\n\nI've heard of the WoC dining packages and have done some research, but I have one very specific question: are the fastpasses that you receive unique to the dining packages (i.e., you get extra-good seats reserved JUST for people who have done the dining package), or are they the same fastpasses from the general WoC fastpass distribution? \n\n\nThe reason why I am asking is because I want to get a good idea of how soon I'd have to start saving seats for WoC later that night. I'm going with a fairly big group of people and it'll be most of their first times watching World of Color.

I'd probably want to stay in one of the resort hotels (the cheaper the better!) and I recently saw a deal for getting 2 weeks for the price of 1 which I thought was probably a good deal. Fortunately I have no real restrictions (kids in school, work related holiday restrictions) on \nwhen\n I visit, so with a mind to avoid holidays\/summer peak season, I assumed the best time of year would probably be around Feb\/March\/April or after the summer (although I assume there might be a price\/attendance spike around the Halloween\/Thanksgiving\/Christmas times....??)\n\n\nIf anyone can chip in their two cents I'd be most grateful! :-)",

  "text":"So I started working for Disneyland last year around this time and it was awesome. One day on New Years Eve, I called in sick to work. I was going through a lot during that time with school, 2 jobs, and personal problems. Later that week I called and pretty much said I wouldn't be able to work anymore. So I pretty much got fired. Now I realized what a huge mistake I made. A few months later I went into casting to ask my status and they said I have a no rehire status and I had to wait a year so I can petition to get that no rehire removed and they said I had to hold a job for at least 6 months. I've held a job for more than that now. What do you guys think of my situation? And what can I do to help my chances? Who can\/should I talk to? I know I messed up. Everyone makes mistakes. I've learned from mine. I just want my job back at Disneyland..",

  "text":"Quick background:  It's my husband's first trip to any Disney park, and my first trip to DL in several years. It's just us. I DID get to go to WDW this summer (without him), so how some stuff works is really fresh in my memory, but the World is a whole different planet from DL, and your local expertise would be \nreally\n appreciated!\n\n\n\n\nwhat's the status on returning late for your fastpass window? I read they were cracking down on this lately; how true is that?\n\n\n\n\nAre the three DCA attractions with \"disconnected\" FP machines still:  WoC, Racers, and Screamin? If so, can I theoretically pull passes for those three plus another attraction (say, Soarin') first thing? I've read conflicting things about Screamin's status.\n\n\n\n\nBest app for wait times? I have the unofficial guide's Lines, and a couple others that I like less, but is there another? The official Disneyland app has pretty limited practical use compared to the one for WDW, so I feel like I'm missing something.\n\n\n\n\nThoughts on dining package vs. fastpass for WoC? especially with the new show? \n\n\n\n\nCan someone ELI5 how early entry works? We're staying at a good neighbor hotel across the street, and we have 3-day park-hoppers with one-day early entry... can we choose which park on what day or what? I \nthink\n it only works for disneyland park (never DCA) and only on tuesday, thursday, or saturday?\n\n\n\n\nlooks like storybook land canal boats \/ casey jr.'s train is closed? That's according to disney's website, but the blogosphere is weirdly quiet about it, so I'm not sure why?\n\n\n\n\nany insider information on the candlelight processional? I saw some posts that expected it to be on the 7th and 8th, but nothing on the official website at all!\n\n\n\n\nIn theory, I'd like to watch the 9p Fantasmic and not move my keester for the fireworks. (This would be Friday night, if that makes a difference as far as how early we need to camp out a spot or what spot to camp?)\n\n\n\n\nusually there's a fastpass thing for Haunted mansion holiday - but i heard they're not using it this year?\n\n\n\n\nSo Big Thunder is still down for OSHA refurb... I don't suppose there's any chance they'll do a soft re-opening or something and we'll get SUPER DUPER lucky?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi, my name is SSF, and I'm an over-planner. \ngrin\n I realize that wall o' text is a bit much; thanks for any answers!",

First priority is getting on RSR in as little time as possible so we have the most time to enjoy the rest of the park. I THOUGHT the best thing to do would be to get their 30 minutes before the park opens and get a fastpass immediately. But from reading other's accounts, it sounds like even if you get there first thing you still have to wait 30 minutes just to get the fastpass and then another 20 minutes in the fastpass line when your time comes.\n\n\nSo now I'm thinking we should just head to the actual ride it's self first thing. Maybe even just do single rider. My only concern is that it is a extra magic hour day at CA. What will the standby and single rider lines be like at rope drop? And what are they like during WoC and an hour before the park closes? Maybe I should start with DL and do CA\/Radiator Springs last?",

If anyone happens to have had their interest piqued, please let me know if any of that sort is worth my posting.\n\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with the College Program, I invite you to pay \nthe website\n a visit and learn what it's all about! \n\n\nAs a tl;dr, the standard Program is a semester-long internship with the Walt Disney Company, where participants work in the parks under certain designated roles, attend classes held by Disney on Resort property, and live near-by for easy access to their full-time positions.\n\n\nMy Program is this Spring, from January until August, and will include seminars from department heads and corporate honchos, trips to the Studios, a tour of Walt's apartment, Space ride-through with lights on, etc etc beyond the basic rudiments of toil. Work, work, and more work, for which I have no apprehensions.\n(Bring it on.)  \n\n\nMy specific role happens to be Attractions, and I am beyond stoked and motivated to make the most of my time with the company as a Cast Member. I'll be attending any\/most of the events offered during the program, and hopefully that will allow me to consistently report on the conditions and experiences I have for all of you to share in.\n\n\nAs you may be aware, there is a DCP sub as well (as noted in the sidebar) of which I am a moderator, so if this is information you'd rather see contained there I understand. There just so happens to be far less traffic there than the graveyards of Chernobyl, so I thought I'd pose myself here instead.\n\n\nIf nothing else, thanks for sharing in my excitement.

I do not remember many details except that he spent a decent amount of time talking about the \"bones\" of dead rides and animatronics being buried under the streets of the area. As well it was a longer video(at least 20 mins but I think closer to 45) and was a video of an actual unofficial tour. Has anybody seen this video and can direct me, or even have any details to help my search?",

It could be for the simplest thing. If they freakin' smiled at you when everyone else was frowning, that's more than enough. I make it a point to do this for cast members every time I'm a DLR, because as an ex cast member, I know how much I REALLY appreciated those guest compliments.\n\n\nIn fact, we should have one of the mods post a topic every Sunday where you could post the name of the cast member, where you met them, and what they did to make your day brighter.\n\n\nFood for thought.

So, as I said, I've got lots of experience with the Florida parks, but i've never really been out to the Anaheim parks before (well, I spent 6 hours in Disneyland once, years ago, but that doesn't really count as far as trip planning goes).  I'm thinking of planning a trip out there for a week or so.  \n\n\nMy questions are thus:\n\n\nWhats the least busy time of year?  I was there on 4th of July in 2003, and it was (strangely) pretty dead- but I can't imagine this is true most of the time.  At WDW it's usually mid-to-late September to early October, but I suspect that's not the case over on the left coast, what with more locals being there regularly.   \n\n\nMy other question is- is there any real benefit to staying at the Disney hotels?  Given the proximity of the Good Neighbor hotels, I tend to think not, but with the utter horror of staying off-site in Orlando, I figure it's in my best interests to ask.  \n\n\nThanks for any input you may have!",

I think. \n\n\nThese past two days were spent stamping pennies all around DL and CA. Today was a CA day and I last remember having the book in my hands around 5pm by the midway at Paradise Pier. I had just gotten the Toy story pennies from the tshirt shop. \n\n\nI could have lost it anywhere between there and Goofy's Kitchen at DL Hotel. The route taken was from the midway towards California Screaming and out across the bridge and headed to Bugs Land. From there we went to Radiator Springs. I can't recall how many or what rides we went on up to this point, unfortunately. We then went through the Hollywood backlot to the Muppet theater, then out to the Buena Vista shops and then back through Condor Flats and into the Grand Californian hotel. We went through the lobby out to Downtown Disney and straight to Goofy's Kitchen. \n\n\nAfter having dinner there for our kid's birthday, we went out to those two penny machines by the old Autopia car. We got all 6 of the coins there and when I reached for the book in my side pocketing my cargo shorts\u2026 it was gone. Damn! So either I misplaced it, or it may have popped out on one of the rides between Point A and Point B. \n\n\nSo umm yeah if anyone just so happened to find it, we would really appreciate a PM. It's the time an effort lost that the most upsetting. We made it our mission to collect all the stamped coins this year, but looks like we'll have to start from scratch unless by some stoke of luck someone here came upon it.

  "title":"Visiting Disneyland but only going to DCA... Will I regret it??",
  "text":"I'm a British Disnerd (my own invented word....) who is lucky enough to have been to Disneyland\/Disney's California Adventure twice in the past three years. Each time I've been we've only had one day to do both parks but have managed to see pretty much everything both times, albeit with some rushing... \n\n\nI'm headed out to California AGAIN this summer but the people I'm travelling with aren't hugely interested in going to Disneyland. However, my opinion is, it'd be stupid to come 5000+ miles and not visit one of my favourite places on Earth, so I'm going to try and make the effort to visit, even if I have to go by myself.\n\n\nMy plan, however, is to only visit DCA this time as there's loads of stuff there that I love (Tower Of Terror is probably one of my favourite attractions of all theme parks!! And Radiator Springs Racers...what can I say?!) and I'd kinda like to devote a whole day to it as there's stuff there I haven't even seen before (like World Of Colour, and the Toy Story Midway Mania thing etc...). \n\n\nSo my question is, do people think it's possible to be happy only visiting DCA if I only have one day to do it in? Or will I get there and wish I'd been able to hop over to the main park for a bit as well?! I realise DCA closes earlier than Disneyland, but we'll be driving up and back from San Diego in a day, so will be a good 2hrs of travel time either end of our trip, which might make the earlier finish not such a bad thing... Obviously, in a perfect world I'd have friends who wanted to spend a couple of days in there with me, but unfortunately it's just not possible here (unless any fellow Disnerd Redditors would like to accompany me?!).",

  "title":"Thank you \/r\/Disneyland ! Our 1st family vacation was a success. here's a recap part 1",
  "text":"I thought I\u2019d give an update on the family vacation we took to the Disneyland  resort last week. The trip was over three days, So I will cover each day in a separate post. I want to thank the Redditors here for all of their valuable advice, as well as the good people over at Touring Plans and Mouse Addict, who I used to help plan and get around the parks.\n\n\nDay1\n\n\nLegoland\n\n\nWe flew out from the midwest early Tuesday morning and arrived in San Diego about 30 min later than our flight was scheduled. after getting our rent-a-car and stopping for lunch in at In-N-Out, we arrived at Legoland around 12:00. Lines weren't terribly long, We used a touring plan created by \/u\/malacoid and modified it based on our own interest. We wrapped things up by 4:30 and headed up the coast. I could go into more detail if asked, but i\u2019ll leave it at it was a good prequel to the the rest of the trip. Overall we probably won't go back and probably would have had a more fun time flying into John Wayne Airport and going straight to DCA. However, the kids are big into legos right now so it was a good idea to at least experience it once. Miniland was impressive and the Star Wars models brought my inner nerd out. The drive from Carlsbad to Anaheim served as a good nap time for the kids (and dad).\n\n\nGrand Californian Hotel \n\n\nWe got to The Grand Californian Hotel around 5:50, Kids were in shock as we didn\u2019t tell them we were going, took them awhile to wake from the groggy post nap car ride. The check-in was mostly painless, Valet, Bellhops, and front desk were superb. Hotel was a little darker than I expected but just as beautiful as I imagined. While we checked in, kids sat in cute chairs and watched Disney cartoons. My wife\u2019s birthday was in a couple of days so we got a kick out of the birthday button and were impressed with cast members immediate \u201chappy birthday\u201d responses throughout the trip. We were slightly upgraded from a partial courtyard view to a pool view, It looked great at night especially with the full moon. We checked into our rooms around evening turn-down service time, housekeeping gave us a ton of chocolate ! The kids enjoyed the bunk beds and the attention to Disney detail was cute. However, I have been in better rooms before. Overall the room was good, the lobby and public areas great ! Service  Excellent !  I surprised my wife with flowers in the room, they held up well the entire week. gift department followed directions to a tee and were very accommodating. \n\n\nAriel\u2019s Grotto \n\n\nOriginally the plan was to use Pinocchio's workshop and go out for the night just us two at DCA, but once we got to Legoland  we decided to run an audible,  take our time and bring the kids with us to dinner that night.  I had already made reservations for Wine Country with World of Color priority viewing. I called dinning and they allowed me to change the party number from 2 to 5 with no penalty, but they moved us to Ariel\u2019s Grotto instead.  Entering straight into DCA from the Grand Californian was convenient and we used a few moments to just take in the park and its aesthetics. Once we arrived at Ariel\u2019s Grotto, It took a little longer than expected, but not an uncommon wait. I was disappointed in both the hostess attitude and lackluster service from the server we had, However, the location was perfect being adjacent to the water outside.It was also cool watching the final set up for WOC, and listening to the  sound of the park in full bloom. The food was decent, but I have had better. I\u2019m not sure I would bring a family of five there again, but maybe just the two of us.  Also no Character Experience that late , which we were ok with. We did think it was odd that the music played were dinner style versions of Disney classic movies, but not once did we hear a Little Mermaid song ! How Ironic.\n\n\nWonderful World of Color\n\n\nAfter dinner we did a stroll around Paradise Pier, sizing things up for the next day. then we entered the special \u201cseating\u201d area for World of Color. We found some great seats near the front, but when they asked everyone to stand to make more room, we decided to move back a bit to make sure the kids could see, that\u2019s when I remember a redditor had suggested finding a spot of the stairs so you could still sit. dealing with people trying to find a good spot to see was when the reality of being in a major themed park set in. Cast members were great despite the obvious frustrations they had with people, overall I think some improvement can be had to how the  park handles and queues the crowds for WOC. Later I found out that as guest we could've received an early fastpass to the viewing area. Since we arrived late to the park I doubt it would have helped us, but I am not sure in retrospect spending the extra money on priority seating was worth the cost. The show itself was phenomenal ! It really made us buy into the magic of what we had just begun to experience, It was during the show that I saw my kids (and our) eyes light up. It was fun watching my kids guess what movie clip was being shown during the show. For three months prior we had be secretly conditioning them to the Disney trip by watching Disney movie\u2019s every weekend, the conditioning paid off. Although to my dismay I forgot to show them Aladdin, this worked in our favor as when the Aladdin songs came on, my Seven year old whispers with interest \u201cwho\u2019s that?\u201d and \u201ci like those songs !\u201d Turns out moving back was a smart idea, our former standing area was soaked! The walk back was easy. The kids were asleep in 1 minute. Parents were asleep in 5. I'll cover our experience at DCA in other post.",

Our daughter is our own little piece of magic and we can't wait to take her back to where it all started. She will be 6 months old when we go.\n\n\nOk, so now the real question\n\n\nWe are going with my In-Laws and Sister-In-Law with her daughter (who will be 1 when we go). The dates for our trip were out of my control (my in-laws couldn't come if we didn't go on their dates), so we are going to be in the park June 9-11. The 10-11 are both grad nights, so that is an added factor.\n\n\nWhat tips and tricks do you have for navigating the park with children this young? And for dealing with Grad-Night?\n\n\nThanks in advance!",

During the past week of moderating this subreddit, we've hit subreddit drama. \n\n\nMany of you know about the user who has began to run rampant in the subreddit. We are doing everything in our control to contain the situation. However, the other mods and I cannot be on Reddit 24\/7. In fact, only a few of us are actively moderating. IAMA-CANADIAN-AMA, lem0nster, myself, our newest moderator: CtrlAltLucas, and every blue moon ReggaeRecipe comes to comment on a matter. The others do not respond during our mod discussions. Nonetheless, every time we ban, it seems another two accounts appear. We have a Hydra loose in our subreddit. \n\n\nThis is where we ask for your help. No matter where you go in this world, there are jerks. It is a fact of life. How you handle it is the difference.\nUnfortunately, many users don't take advantage of the report button, nor do they message us. They try to handle the situation by yelling back, which fuels the user more. If someone harasses you here, we ask that you do not reply. Please contact the mods and we WILL handle it. We remove the comments and warn or ban the user, hopefully within the day.  (Thank you, \/u\/backpackwayne)\n\n\nThere is also the matter of an extreme case of downvotes. This is also a situation that we as mods cannot control. There is no way that we can view who is downvoting everything. I know some things posted aren't \"worthy\" (so to speak) for a vote (I'm guilty of this as well), but to bring us back to full health, I ask for help from the Knights of New.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the admins have yet to reply to our calls for help, regarding our Hydra and our downvote brigade. \n\n\nI've also heard complaints about the lack of moderation in this subreddit. I've recently begun to crackdown on blogspam and bullying. I've only been a moderator for about a week, but I'd like to know what more I can do to help. I'm proud to have earned this position and I love Disneyland, I want to help this community! \n\n\nI open the floor to comments and questions. If you'd like to know more about what we've been doing, I'd be happy to share messages, posts, etc. Do you have a new rule you'd like to propose? Anything at all!\n\n\nTLDR; We are fully aware of the Hydra and downvote brigade, we are trying our best to control the situation. If you have questions about what exactly we've been doing, we'd be happy to answer anything, even if it has nothing to do with this situation at all! :)",

I do, however, try my best to get down there every year as long as it's feasible.  I went earlier in the summer the last two years, so like June\/July, which--as I'm sure you Disney goers know--was pretty crowded.  It wasn't horrible, but it was definitely packed.\n\n\nHowever, I am trying to make up my mind about whether or not I want to go in August or September.  Really, the only issue here is that I don't know how much longer I can wait, but I've been to Disneyland at all times of the years and I've never truly thought that it was TOO busy to the point where I thought I wanted to go home.  \n\n\nSo, I was taking a look at all the largest school district calendars for 2014-15, and it seems that most schools go back, this year, around the end of mid-August to early September.  However, this is also when a lot of the Annual Passport holders are able to come into the park since the blackout dates lift.  I did some research on crowd count the last two years, and each year from 2012-2013, the week of August 12-18, Monday through Thursday-ish were \"Hey, it's Alright\" according to the Crowd Forecast.  \n\n\nThis year, they're predicting the same week will be \"alright\" as well.

  "text":"If you all know the rules on hat embroidery, forgive me. But I just learned this:\n\n\nMy cousin is graduating from med school, so I wanted to get him a pair of graduation mickey ears or the actual graduation cap with ears on top. A few weeks ago, I asked if they would put Dr. _______ or _______, M.D. There was some sort of rule against any professional title, even military titles (Sgt., Col., etc.). They didn't bother explaining it other than that it was their policy. I was just going to buy the hat and take it to a local embroidery business, but I decided not to. \n\n\nI went back to Disneyland last weekend and asked a CM about that hat rule. She said they changed it recently, and it's much more relaxed. Professional titles and military ranks are permitted, but not specific branches of the military. And as long as it's not offensive, it looks like they can even do nicknames, too. \n\n\nIf anyone tries this, let me know if it works for you! I was able get the graduation cap with M.D. stitched on it, so thank you disney for changing that policy right when I needed it!",

I drove 45 minutes to get there and had the same drive back, so you have to know I was really missing Disneyland to make that drive for only 2 hours of park time. \n\n\nI got there, went on Haunted Mansion, saw a little bit of Fantasmic and headed over to Big Thunder Mountain. The wait was 45 minutes so my girlfriend and I were debating whether or not the wait was worth it. Suddenly, two kind strangers walked up to us and handed us Fastpasses to board in 5 minutes. Why? They were tired so they were just going to leave the park. \n\n\nI have done this many times in the past so I'm glad that karma finally came back my way. The fact is you can be a part of that Disneyland magic if you have Fastpasses you aren't going to use. I know that whoever gave us those Fastpasses really made our night, and we even got to ride a couple of Fantasyland dark rides before the park closed. \n\n\nSo if you're heading out or won't make it to the attraction for whatever reason, make someone's day and give away your Fastpass!",

I've seen very mixed points of view. \n\n\nAlso, if there's anything else that we may be overlooking, please let me know! If case we decide to do this, I went ahead and made a reservation made for breakfast at the Plaza Inn (it doesn't look like they are doing the daily birthday parties anymore, which is a shame). We definitely will pick up a birthday button, and likely will spend some quality time in the changing station on Main Street. I think we'll hold off on any other advanced planning, and play it by ear. \n\n\nI know very little about California Adventure. It sounds like it's more laid back and a potential option for the second day? Any first-hand accounts of experiences there with toddlers? \n\n\nAlso, I was spoiled living super-close to WDW growing up, but that meant that we never stayed at any of the resorts.

I thought about taking my 20\" young Simba plushie, but I think that's out of the question. \n\n\nI also have another idea of buying a similar-sized Simba plushie when I get there, and holding him up when the picture snaps on Splash Mountain. :) \n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nApologies if this is the wrong subreddit. Have a drawing I did of my favorite Disney character -  \nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/PlZyeF0.jpg",

At the spur of the moment, I applied my $96 ticket to a Southern California Select annual pass mainly because I wanted to lock in the the $16 a month payment and upgrade later to the Deluxe (while still keeping the $16 monthly payment).\n\n\nHowever, looking at the costs and the parking pass, the Premium Pass is only 20 dollars more expensive than the Deluxe + Parking. I plan to hop down to the parks frequently, so paying to park every single time would be a huge pain\/burden. So what would you do? Would you plop down the extra $410 dollars to go from a SoCal Select to a Premium. I have the money to do so, but I don't know how wise it would be. Any insights? Advice?",

  "text":"Hey guys, I was looking through the costume guidelines \nhere\n and one thing is pretty vague. They say that costumes should be \"child friendly\" but give no indication on what that actually means. There are plenty of costumes that are \nobviously\n child friendly, but what about costumes that are borderline? Like very short dresses (think Tinkerbell) or tights and a leotard (think female comic book superhero, but less showy than the classic Wonder Woman costume). My friends and I always make our costumes from scratch every year so it's not really feasible to have multiple costumes on hand, it would be really disappointing to be turned away at the door because something is considered inappropriate.",

I was wondering if any part of the park (if not the whole) is mystery shopped, and if anyone can point me towards any company that might arrange that? It doesn't have to be within the park itself, it could even be something at Downtown Disney.",

I'm currently pregnant, and we've agreed that we want to make our pregnancy announcement photos Disney themed! We've already booked our stay at Paradise Pier in early October using our DVC points, but sadly, money is a little tight right now, what with our incoming spawn and everything. We're trying to avoid having to buy the $96 per adult park ticket if we can, but still get some nice photos that we can use.\n\n\nDo you know of any photo spots outside of DL and DCA?

  "text":"So I am reading the new 2015 Unofficial Guide to Disneyland and was a little confused by the passage on opening procedures for DCA:\n\n\n\"Disneyland Resort Hotel Guests get a 1-hour jump on the public four or more mornings each week through the Extra Magic Hours Program. You'll be required to show a hotel key card before being allowed through. [...] All other guests will be allowed through the main entrance onto Buena Vista Street up to 1 hour early and held at Carthay Circle until after a brief \"rope drop\" musical fanfare at the official opening time. A queue for Radiator Springs Racers Fastpasses will form stretching through Hollywood Land as soon as visitors are allowed in the gates, and the crowd will be walked toward Cars Land at the appointed hour to avoid a stampede.\"\n\n\nSo, if I read this correctly, an hour BEFORE the public rope drop, if I show up, I can walk onto Buena Vista Street and line up at Carthay Circle for Fastpasses? This is not just for resort guests, yes? I'm just trying to make sure to time my arrival. Our family is pretty interested in saving time, not getting burned on long waittimes and being there with the early birds, not showing up to find that I should've started lining up an hour before the opening. I already planned to be there ~40 minutes, as the Unofficial Guide\/Touringplans.com recommends. \n\n\nThoughts? Experiences?",

  "text":"My hobby is fountain technology, and I finally decided to just (ask the CM if I could) stick my camera right over the fountain after the show and blindly snap several shots, hoping to get some good angles. And I got some.\n\n\nI'm sure everybody knows by now how the center effect is done-- that is, a water jet of varying height with little of the splash associated with a tall water jet-- but for those who don't, here's that info. The smooth jet is created using a transparent riser pipe, which rises and falls. The water then sheets smoothly down the outside of the pipe. Inside the fountain bowl is an anti-splash mesh screen, and a conical 'nozzle' around the opening from which the pipe rises spreads the falling water out across the screen for minimal splash. It's a very mechanically-involved but effective design.\n\n\nOf interest to me, however, were the other nozzles. They were made by Rain Jet, no longer in operation. Rain Jet started making in-ground lawn sprinklers using a patented droplet-dispersal system, and a while later, the company discovered that a modification of the design put up a vertical hollow spinning cone of very large droplets, which were unusually-effective at catching lights. Still later, the 'backwash' around the base of the nozzle from the water used to create the rotation was channeled through a perforated nozzle head to create a lower tier and, still later, two lower tiers. Walt Disney was reportedly enchanted by them and encouraged the creation of a musical show, but he passed before it could go beyond a prototype. The finished show became Sea World's \"Water Fantasy,\" which used all Rain Jet nozzles: five standard designs also sold to the public and at least one custom nozzle design.\n\n\nHere\n is a wide shot of the Tiki Room array. There is an outer ring of nozzles within shrouds made of plastic pipe, then a ring of RGB LED lights, then the pineapples, and then the inner splash screen with more nozzles. The outer ring of nozzles are Rain Jet's \"Crystal Cone\" model, producing a single cone of droplets - the original Rain Jet design.\n\n\nThis photo\n shows the Crystal Cones in their shrouds. Each nozzle has a flat circular weight which causes the drive or thrust water (coming up the sides) to be thrown outward and downward so that it doesn't interfere with the spray effect, and these shrouds contain this backwash. They're plumbed off a central circular pipe under the pineapples. The waterproof lights are also pictured; before they were RGB LED, does anybody know what color lenses were on them?\n\n\nThis\n is a shot looking down through the splash screen. In the center is the geyser pipe at lowest level, surrounded by the cone which aids splash dissipation. Around this are three more Rain Jet nozzles, called the \"Ballerina\" model; their cone sways slightly off-center, and the six channels in the nozzle weight form the plumes of droplets around the base. Two circular manifold pipes can be seen, one plumbing the Crystal Cones, another running the Ballerinas. But does anybody know what type of nozzles, if any, are inside the pineapples? They're plumbed for something!\n\n\nRain Jet was bought by OASE of Germany and slowly closed. Sadly, these wonderful nozzles are no longer made, but I was lucky enough to locate 13 used nozzles, 12 Bursting Stars (a Ballerina with a steady central cone) and one tiny Crystal Cone, so small that it'll produce a pattern only six inches high and not stall. I hope this was interesting and not boring to someone(s) here.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks a lot for the responses! I usually focus on musical and performing fountains - in Disneyland's case, World of Color and Fantasy Waters - but the Tiki Room equipment was especially interesting to me because of the equipment in use, which were the most visually-interesting and arguably best nozzles on the market in the sixties.\n\n\nSpec sheet\n for the Ballerina nozzle.\n\n\nCatalog illustration\n of Bursting Stars and Crystal Cones. The big droplets were likened to prisms by Rain Jet, because of their abilities to sparkle (hence the trade name \"Showers of Diamonds\") and reflect multiple colors of light at once.\n\n\nNozzles were available \nmounted to a solid base\n which held the lights at the proper angle; a two-light model is shown, but larger ones had three and five lights with an optional blender to switch between lights for color changes; a one-light unit positioned the light directly below the nozzle riser. I've got a three-light sans pump, waiting for me to find a suitable location.",

This past Sunday my girlfriend and I were ready to leave the park, we started to file into a line for the \"Mickey and Friends\" tram, as the current one departed a girl (looked to be a teen) broke out into a run and jumped onto the side of the tram. The operators were warning her to get back and then to get off the tram\/telling the driver to stop the tram. After it stopped the girl just got off the side of the tram and walked back over to the waiting area, security was there ASAP and began to ask her questions. \n\n\nMy girlfriend and I overheard some of them, questions involving if she's employed\/has she had anything to drink\/if they can see her ID. The last two seemed normal enough, but the question of employer seemed a bit peculiar, moreso we were wondering what happens next? I assume at the parks they have a holding area for incidents like that, but what happens to someone who breaks the rules like that in Downtown Disney, why is her employer an important question, will she just get a fine or something worse? Sorry if this seems a bit nosy, but we had never seen anyone do something like that at a theme-park, let alone something that warranted more than just a \"hey don't do that\" warning.

  "text":"Went to the parks for the first time in about seven years this past weekend. For reference, I've gone every several years for about 25 years (33 now) and this was the longest I've been away.\n\n\nOverall the parks looked beautiful. I'm in the camp of people who aren't at all upset about the railings on the castle bridge, or too upset about the changes in New Orleans Square. Granted, I do miss the Court of Angels, but the off-center Club 33 window and faux stained glass doors didn't bother me when seeing them in person. I ate dinner in Cafe Orleans and didn't see anyone looking up into Club 33's window or asking about it. \n\n\nQuick thoughts:\n\n\n\n\nLoved the renovated Thunder Mountain. Such a smooth and enjoyable ride with a great new ending scene.\n\n\n\n\nDidn't dig the new (new to me) Star Tours. It's too herky jerky just for the sake of being jerky. All the shaking around is so gimmicky. I prefer the old ride, even though it was getting dated.\n\n\n\n\nI felt so-so about Mansion's holiday overlay. It's kinda awkward when so much of the old elements are there yet out of place.\n\n\n\n\nReally liked Indy's new effects and the new Alice videos and effects. Loved the dark ride effects in Ariel's too. The modern animatronics, especially having the eyes move around, is really cool.\n\n\n\n\nRacers lived up to the hype. I wouldn't kill two hours waiting in line, but I'd wait longer for that than most any other ride. Cars Land is just so impressive.\n\n\n\n\nWorld of Color was nice but I don't need to do it again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy biggest disappointment - and that may be too strong a word - was seeing Splash Mountain. It's one of my top three rides, but it just seems so dated now. The lights that are out and non-functioning animatronics stick out like sore thumbs. The drop is still great, but the dark ride aspects look so bad next to Ariel's, Racers, and the new Alice. Though I'd miss it if I was in the parks while it's down, I hope Splash is next in line for a Thunder-like year-long renovation.\n\n\nI'm definitely not waiting another seven years to return to the parks this time. Looking forward to going next July or August.",

  "text":"went on a fairly packed day about two weeks ago. guessing the wait times of every ride across the park obviously wouldn't do us much good so I had the idea to ask a cast member if there was an app for posting ride wait times. He said there was an unofficial app called mousewait that has wait times and various of Disneyland\/world info. Granted it was difficult to get a connection on my phone at the time, when it did load and get installed, it proved to be very accurate and helpful. we were able to use it plan out which rides were  important to us vs their wait time and which rides were best to get fast passes for and which rides we could just stand in line for. by doing this we could get fast passes for the longest wait times, stand in line for 2 or 3 other rides in the mean time and  then get to our fast pass rides on time.     \n\n\ninterestingly enough it also had wait times for restaurants big and small, how accurate those are though, I dont know, but if they are accurate, could be very useful as well if you're really hungry :D \n\n\nthought I'd share cuz it was super helpful and I'll certainly be using it next time I go too.",

After getting unloaded into the hotel we made our way to Anaheim. It took us about 30 minutes to get off the freeway at Ball and get into the parking structure. So I was slightly frustrated but wasn't going to be deterred... I love Disneyland and won't let anything ruin it.\n\n\nWe ended up going to Flo's to get some much needed food and beer. The cast members were great and the clerk and I got to talking and i mentioned our travels. Upon ordering and getting the food we realized there was only one entree on the ticket when we had ordered two. I was slightly crushed and said that I'll just go order another one. The line was pretty long so it was a bit daunting after a long day. But as I was about to get ready to order the cast member at the food pickup counter told me they'll take care of it. I asked him if he could take my card and he told me not to worry about it, that I waited so long to get here that I shouldn't wait any longer to get some much needed food.\n\n\nDisneyland makes me so freaking happy.

As you well know, CMs will ask that everyone remain on the tile floor, away from the walls. Every time I step on this floor, it feels - strange? I guess? I get vertigo really easily (though not on the ToT ride itself, thankfully), and stepping onto that floor often makes me feel as if a vertigo spell is coming on. I mentioned this to my sister, and she said she feels there's something odd going on with the floor, as well (though at this point, it may just be the power of suggestion).\n\n\nSo help me out! Is there a specific reason that guests are supposed to stay away from the walls? Is there some kind of function that the tile floor has that we just haven't been able to place? Does it move at all?

  "text":"Last year my wife and I got into pin trading at the park.  Pretty fun stuff.. but there are \nSO MANY PINS\n!  So, I thought it would be fun to start collecting the pressed pennies.  I figured it would be easy since there are very few machines in the park.. or so I thought.  I googled \"penny press machine locations in Disneyland\" and stumbled upon this site, \nhttp:\/\/www.parkpennies.com\/\n  It looks like once again, I'm getting in way over my head, but I'm already too excited to cut and run.\n\n\nAre any of you collectors of these?  If so, how often do they change the designs in the machines?  How big is your collection?  Should I stick to pins?",

  "title":"Disneyland Disc Ornaments",
  "text":"When my wife was growing up, her mom always managed to make a yearly trip to Disneyland during the holiday season. Every trip they also obtained the yearly disc ornaments that Disneyland put out. This continued as a tradition even after my wife and I married. In June of 2011, my wife's mother passed. We managed to make the annual trip in 2011, but could not afford the ornaments. That was the last trip we were able to make. This year I have been contemplating what I could do to bring at least a little of this lost tradition back to my wife. With this in mind, is there any location online that I could obtain the ornaments from these lost years? I have seen some on ebay, but is this the best place, or is there a better location?

My original plan was to just take her for Christmas but then I started adding up the cost and thought it might be better if we both just buy our own pass. The only one worth getting would be the Deluxe since we mostly would only be able to go during our days off, weekends, and maybe when we decide to skip school\/work. The price of the pass has been stopping me from telling my GF about my idea because I'm 99% sure she'd want to get it. So is there anything else I should consider before deciding if I want to get it?

We are 25\/26 with no kids and are new to SoCal. We are both from Oregon which is very lacking in any kind of major theme parks. As a result we were both familiar with Disneyland as it was a family vacation for both of us when we were younger but neither of us has experienced any of the other parks in the area (I've been to 6 Flags New England but that is my only non-disney theme park experience).\n\n\nWe were considering taking a Saturday to see one of the other parks and we were shocked at the differences in pass prices. \n\n\nI know Disney goes above and beyond when it comes to delivering a great experience but after doing the math it came out to the fact that we could get an annual pass at literally every other park in So Cal for about the same price as our Disney passes.\n\n\nWe are not considering getting rid of our Disney passes but it makes me wonder if the other parks are able to charge so much less are they even worth going? It seems like most of them have their prices at a point where if you are going to go one day you may as well just get the annual pass since it's just a little bit more (Universal actually includes it with the purchase of a 1 day pass).\n\n\nHow would you compare DL\/DCA to the other parks in SoCal? Are any of them worth driving to\/paying for or would you just stick to Disney?\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\nNote: The main reason we were looking at the other parks other than branching out from Disney is we both enjoy thrill rides and feel like Disney has some good options but we were thinking something new may be fun.",

  "text":"I'm here waiting for Fantasmic! to start and so far my SO and I are incredibly disappointed with the new Fastpass system. Although yes it is Xmas day and the park is at capacity, it seems Disneyland has some shortsighted ideas about their implementation of the system. Cast members themselves are confused giving different directions about procedures. \n\n\nThey insist there won't allow any lines before the assigned time but a crowd of people milling about still forms. I'm in the Blue section and were told to meet at the Mark Twain entrance, then told to go to front of Horshoe saloon, and later found out a separate entrance is availible in front of the French Market. To get out you have to get a fastpass back and they'll let you back in. But seems to me it's ripe for abuse. \n\n\nWhen the news of the fastpass system first came out we were willing to give it a chance since we though every section would be availible, but it turns out the front sections are reserved for those who have bought the dinner packages exclusively. Meaning you pay to get the best. Well looks like They found a new way to make more money from us. \n\n\nSorry about the rambling just had to vent. Been to San Diego Comic Con for years amongst others and I just hope they figure this out soon rather than have people bum rush a small opening in Frontierland only to get a space on front of a tree.  \n\n\nAnybody else have better luck or a less stressful experience?",

  "title":"Frozen Fun overview and tips",
  "text":"DCA was surprisingly empty yesterday, so it gave me a chance to check out all of the different things the Frozen Fun takeover of Hollywood Land has to offer. Here are a few tips:\n\n\n\n\nThe Anna and Elsa meetup in the Animation Building requires Fastpasses. They're distributed from a mobile kiosk outside the building. These are the same mobile kiosks (big white rectangular box on wheels) used to distribute Fantasmic tickets. Shockingly, tickets were still available at 6 p.m. yesterday for an 8:30 p.m. return.\n\n\n\n\nThere aren't any other major changes in the Animation Building, except that the Animation Academy (drawing class) only features lessons on drawing Olaf and Marshmallow (the snow monster from Frozen). Also, they added a \"Let it Go\" sequence to the rotation of art\/music in the main room.\n\n\n\n\nThe \"For The First Time In Forever\" singalong in the Muppets 4D theater (now known as the Crown Jewel Theatre) doesn't require Fastpass tickets, but they are available near the theater exit. They come from the same type of mobile Fastpass kiosks used for Fantasmic and the Anna and Elsa meetup. Fastpass holders enter the theater waiting room (you don't go right into the theater) first, then they let people in the standby line in. We walked in via the standby line just fine, probably because I don't think anyone knew about the Fastpass machine unless CMs told them. It wasn't marked at all, so it wasn't clear that there were Fastpasses available.\n\n\n\n\nThe Olaf meetup in \"Olaf's Snow Fest\" does NOT require Fastpasses. Instead, it works on a pager system. You wait in line outside the building (formerly known as Stage 17, next to Monsters Inc.) to get a pager. Then you have a 30-45 minute wait after you get a pager. You can go anywhere in Hollywood Land (from Tower of Terror to the Playhouse Disney Junior theater) and still receive the page. We received it while in the Animation Building.\n\n\n\n\nOlaf's Snow Fest has a lot to offer. I think the intention is that while you wait for Olaf, you can play in the snow. They blow snow in to a play area, where kids can run around, build snowmen, and slide down a hill on sleds. No snowball fights. In addition, there's a store there (with the same Frozen merch available everywhere and at Wandering Oaken's Trading Post) and a snack stand with mini corn dogs and meatballs among other things. I'd have tried the meatballs, but they looked like they'd been sitting there all day.  On top of all there, there are live musicians (the Fantastic Fjords or something like that) and I believe a comedy act (didn't stay long enough to check them out) that perform inside.\n\n\n\n\nWandering Oaken's has all the same Frozen merch you've already seen. Pressed coin fans should know it has a pressed dime machine with Anna, Elsa and Olaf, 75 cents plus the dime to be pressed.\n\n\n\n\nFreeze the Night! (the Mad Tea Party replacement) is what you'd expect. One cool thing is that there's live ice carving. Also, near where the arcade (RIP Flynn's Arcade) used to be (RIP Flynn's Arcade), there's a huge Marshmallow puppet that you can take pictures with. Two CMs control the arms\/body by swinging around the arms. It's a great photo op.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think that's it. If you've got questions, feel free to ask.",

Sadly, this Sunday is the last day we're going because her pass expires and she's moving back home to the bay since we both finish college this year.\n\n\nI feel like after coming to Disneyland so often, we've seen and done a majority of the things to do. We have her MUST DO rides, attractions and food already planned out. Fantasmic is her favorite thing so we're going to do the dessert reservation. \n\n\nBeyond that, I really want to do one last thing for her that we haven't done, or buy her something very unique to let her know I've appreciated all the Disneyland adventures we've had together.\n\n\nSo I come to you reddit for any suggestions at all :)",

  "text":"Once upon a time, there was a day of the year that was the most idyllic time to visit the Happiest Place on Earth. People from miles around, whom had very little interest in a televised game where grown men fight over a misshapen ball, would travel to Disneyland to enjoy the much smaller crowds than normal.\n\n\nWhile Super Bowl Sunday is no longer a very quiet day at the park, I was wondering if perhaps those of us in Southern California would be interested having an informal Reddit Meet Up\/Pin Trading Day there. The date is February 1st. If enough of us have annual passports, we could meet inside one of the parks. (Only the So Cal Select Passport is blocked out on that date.) If there aren't enough of us here with annual passports, we could find a spot to meet at Downtown Disney, as there is no admission and parking is free for three hours. Non-annual pass holders and out-of-towners there that day are absolutely welcome!\n\n\nThoughts? Suggestions? Show of hands from those interested? Also, hello from the mod of \/r\/DisneyPinTrading!",

  "text":"Alright, I'm not totally dumb in regards to this; I've checked Disney's piercing policy.\n\n\n> \nBody Alteration:\n Intentional body alteration or modification for the purpose of achieving a visible, physical effect that disfigures, deforms or similarly detracts from a professional image is prohibited. Examples include, but are not limited to: visible tattoos, brands, \nbody piercing (other than traditional ear piercing for women)\n, tongue piercing or splitting, tooth filing, earlobe expansion and disfiguring skin implants. Tattoos must be discreetly and completely covered at all times. Jewelry, spacers, retainers, or plugs are not permitted in any body piercing, including non-visible piercings, while working.\n\n\nThe question stems from a friend of mine claiming one of her relatives was denied a job with Disney because she had too many holes in her ears (three in one, five in the other, but two of the five are scarred over and thus, non-functioning; none of the piercings had ever been stretched). Supposedly, she wasn't wearing any earrings at the time of the interview, either, but they claimed they couldn't hire her because of the dress code and specified that her ears were the problem.\n\n\nMy question is: would one really be denied for something like this? I know Disney has a strict code for everything, but I'm hoping this was just a fluke. I've wanted to work for Disney for as long as I can remember (my dream is to be a stilt-walker in the parades), but I got my earlobes double-pierced about ten years ago, before I checked into\/realized there was such a thing as the \"Disney look\". I've got no other piercings at the moment, no tattoos, no body mods, ears have never been stretched, and am perfectly capable of keeping my earrings out for any length of time. Would I really be given the boot for having more than one pin-prick hole per ear?",

However the store is apparently incapable of refunding them.\n\n\nI feel so bad for her, she was almost brought to tears when I noticed the technicality. She must have been saving for a while, this is money she can't really afford in the first place, she is struggling to keep her house as it is.\n\n\nHow helpful is Disney in situations like these, do you think there is a possibility of using the cards as credit towards tickets on other dates?

From February 7th- 28th, the gallery will be hosting \nThe Story of Disneyland\n. We'd love for everyone to take the time to visit the gallery with us on February 28th at 10 AM.\n\n\nMarch: \nSPRING DAPPER DAY\n! Our fall meet up was quite the hit! We'd love to spend the day with our fellow redditors in their Sunday best. We'll meet on the top deck of the Mark Twain for a trip around the Rivers of America at 11AM. From there, we'll decide what to ride together. If you'll be heading to the park, we'll be posting a live feed of where we'll be headed.\n\n\nApril: This is going to be the most exciting meetup yet. A SCAVENGER HUNT! More details will be announced for this one, but we can't wait to explore the parks with you! (And yes, there will be a prize!)\n\n\nMay: 24 HOUR DAY!

We still provide the reason, but the post is no longer visible to others.\n\n\n\n\nTheme Days\n\n\nThe moderators have heard your call.

I went last year at the same time, and ended up going on one of the grad nights. Is there a way to find out beforehand what days these are going to be? I'm not worried about the crowd sizes or being with HS kids, I'm just worried about getting kicked out of California Adventure. \n\n\nThanks all!",

I've always been interested in how you guys pull off such a great show every day. I'm sure there's info online\/maybe even YouTube documentaries but probably not in as much techie detail as I'd like....! \n\n\nFor example, every time I get the chance to visit the park (not often, living in the UK as I do), I'm always amazed by the turnaround for the Fantasmic show.

Only Disneyland could come up with such a fantastic way to hide all the tech required for a show of that caliber for the 90% of the day that it's not actually required. But I've never actually been around when the stacks pop up... I assume it takes a cast member to rope them off etc... Do they all come up at once? How often are they checked? And how 'all weather' are they? Is there a tech spec of what's currently used on the show lighting fixture\/speaker box-wise? And where is it all operated from? What control desks etc?

Will this hurt my interview? Should I take it out anyway if I really do want to be hired?\n\n\nI have a tattoo on my ankle. Should I hide it for my interview or will we discuss that all I'll really need is pants or a high sock to hide it? Because I do have a dress that I wear to interviews but I could buy some dress pants if it should be hidden.\n\n\nIs scheduling bad once hired? I heard a few stories about how people would get scheduled when they have classes and such. I mean once and awhile I wouldn't mind but if it happened constantly it'd be an obvious problem. \nThanks for any help and I'm sorry if this is super repetitive but I'm so excited that I even got an interview I want to make sure it goes well.

I'm really enjoying learning about Walt's perseverance, kindness, imagination, and all the things that almost didn't happen over and over again (read: Disneyland). A fun way to learn more about the land we all love so much and what a fantastic feat it is.

So can someone clarify this for me, are there rides and attractions at the park and if so is there a ride that is also classified as an attraction?

This is dividing the fuel and hotel cost between me and the other adult. \n\n\nI imagine I don't want to spend more than $200 on miscellaneous treats\/souvenirs during the trip. I plan to pack meals for myself and my daughter the whole way. \n\n\nI'm saving $100 a month starting this month and if at all possible a little extra.

  "title":"What I learned from today's pin release in hopes that it could help out anyone in the future!",
  "text":"So first of all, this was my first special event release for a pin so I went in not knowing what to expect.\nI gathered as much information about the release and the process with the wristbands and so on. \n\n\n(Big shout out to \/u\/hhairy for all the help!)\n\n\nSo this was my plan, it was in my knowledge that downtown disney parking was open all throughout the night. Wristbands were to be distributed by rainforest cafe at 6:00am. I was notified by a CM to get there EARLY and wait in line. And so this is what went down.\n\n\nI get there and parking for donwtown disney is closed. (mind you this was the entrance on Magic way.) and right oustside the entrance was this small line. I got there at 4AM as I was not about to miss out on this! \nThis is where it gets tricky\n\n\nYour first mission is to park, and so I go to this residential area and park and then walk my way back up to that line I saw. This is where I made a good friend Randy and his crew of pin traders (Shout out to you if you read this man! You guys were very welcoming!) And so I line up with them and await. So here I am about the 3rd group in line to get this pin. We are casually waiting and time is going on, literally in 30 min the line trippled in size. But at around 5:30 a CM comes up and we think he is going to escort us. He begins stating that this is not a real line. \nDisney rules state that for these types of events you cannot arrive to wait before 6AM\n so our very long line of people was an unofficial line that was created. The real line formed inside downtown disney as soon as Downtown Disney parking had opened.  (the line we were in is a line that is very frequently formed for these events and is often honored but no one told us our line was unofficial until later that day) \n\n\nLuckily Disney always knows the right way to do things and couldn't blame our lack of knowledge against us so what they did was merge the existing (real) line of people who lined up in downtown disney and our line of early birds. One group at a time from each line formed a new line. This new line was assembled in rows in front of the hotel  in one of the parking lots. it was very well done as those who got there early were in front of the line. Wristbands were then distributed in this line after a headcount of everyone there. Wristbands were passed out at approximately 6:50am. You were given a choice of wristband to either claim your pin inside disneyland or go to the pin traders in DD.It was still first come first serve basis. Now all that was left was wait in a line outside the store and wait for it to open (7:45 for me). By the time I bought the pin it was 8:10am. (Note: I was among the first in line so wait times from obtaining my wristband to buying the pin were very very short compared to everyone behind me).\n\n\nMY ADVICE\/ MY NEXT PLAN:\n\n\n\n\nHonor the 6 AM rule.\n\n\n\n\nI advise if you get there really early you find parking in a residential area and instead of forming a line anywhere casually stroll around or wait near DD until parking opens, where you can then rush to form a line near Rainforest Cafe. (Technically our line could have rushed in to the OFFICIAL line but we were under the assumption we were the official line so we stayed put). [\nDO NOT PARK IN THE APARTMENT COMPLEX\n]\n\n\n\n\nIf you get there a bit later, circle around the whole DD area by car until parking opens up. (this is what I saw many cars do and were able to make the official line ) Remember any lines formed before 6AM are not valid. From what I've heard this was the biggest turnout so far for the pin so I can only assume it will increase for the next pin. \n\n\n\n\nBe aware of what times the parking lots open, since this was a magic hour day, parking was open 90 minutes before entrance to magic hour (correct me if I'm mistaken).\n\n\n\n\nSecurity officers and Cm's at the booths to entrance to any parking lot are aware of the situation and will usually provide an answer of \"I don't know what you are going to do but you cannot park here\"\n\n\n\n\nLastly, things will not always go according to plan, Cast members may have to make adjustments in order to make everything work, also be patient as not all of them know the exact situation. Make a friend and keep yourself updated with the situation. Be sure to follow directions and keep calm. \nYou are very likely to get a pin if you remain calm and arrive early enough\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is where I was lined up, on the sidewalk facing into DD on Magic Way.\n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/iBHX9B4\n\n\nThese were the lines still waiting to receive wristbands after I had already bought mine:\n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/hcLW0WG\n\n\nYay for pins!\n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/MHiqNsZ\n\n\nPlease comment any other advice you may have or if you think I should change some of my content. Good luck to everyone I'll see you next month! \n\n\nedit1: I now realize I didn't quite follow the 6 am rule, but I wasn't really sure what it was until today or how it worked. Now I understand  and I don't want to make that mistake again!",

  "title":"My kids almost ruined my Disneyland trip!!",
  "text":"Hopefully this doesn't violate any rules (I'm still new here), but I needed to vent some. \n\n\nYears ago my husband and I decided that we would take our family to DL every time one of the kids turns 5. Today was our second trip (the last trip was 3 years ago). The first time we went it was a complete surprise. Our daughter only knew once we were inside! This time around we had made it obvious. I spent six months planning the trip. I researched everything I could find, made a countdown, reserved a pirate themed suite at a Good Neighbor hotel... I spent so much time making sure it was as close to perfect as we could get on our very limited budget. \n\n\nLast night my kids were so excited that they refused to sleep. They went to bed at their normal bedtime, but didn't fall asleep until about four hours later. This became my first mistake. \n\n\nAfter a quick breakfast we hit the park right at 8. My middle daughter had a 9:10 appointment for the Bibbidi Boppidi Boutique, so we hit Fantasyland at the opening. My oldest daughter had a screaming freak out when we tried to walk straight on to Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. Middle was scared through it and cried. Luckily Pinnochio went off without a hitch. \n\n\nWe hit BBB, and Middle was transformed into Rapunzel! My parents gave us $200 for this for her birthday. After an hour the dress was too \"itchy\" and she made me take it off. During this complete meltdown she also tried to rip her hairpiece off while Oldest had a meltdown and refused to go on Pirates of the Caribbean. \n\n\nAfter diffusing the situation we spent the next few hours in peace (carrying around that dang expensive dress). At nightfall, Middle had a complete meltdown. She was on the ground screaming about nothing. Youngest had managed to pee through her THIRD diaper of the day, in my lap! I had run out of diaper (I even thought I overpacked). Husband insisted that I had to have a corn dog and stood in a 45 minute line with both kids screaming at us (he was trying to be chivalrous about it, so it was very hard to fight him on it). \n\n\nAll in all I spent half an hour sitting at the corner bakery crying because my kids were too exhausted and spoiled to appreciate anything I had done and I was covered in pee. I also felt terrible that my parents had shelled out so much cash for a dress that sat in the bottom of the stroller the whole time. (I did later acknowledge that part of my meltdown was hormonal) We could only afford one day in the park, so I was completely heartbroken to leave an hour before the fireworks. \n\n\nYes, I realize that I probably should have built in a nap for Middle (Youngest slept in her stroller inside the park), but she won't take them and it probably would have been a bigger meltdown to leave the park midday. Plus this is a very rare trip for us, so we wanted to squeeze out as much time as possible and we tried to explain that to them. \n\n\nI know they'll appreciate it and rave tomorrow about the amazing time they had, but I'll remember. Next time I won't tell them so they'll get a lot of sleep the night before! \n\n\nGood Lord I sound whiney, but it felt good to get that out!",

I spoke with him about the Matterhorn closure and what was happening with it. I asked about new tracks, new paints, new additions, and more. \n\n\nThe first thing he told me is that they are not changing the tracks. Made me a little bummed out since I was looking forward to a smoother track... But oh well. \n\n\nThe second thing he told me is that they are updating the ride control\/management system. (Which is why some of you saw some tracks being removed.) This will not have an effect on the user side of the ride, but will be all backend tweaks. \n\n\nThe third thing is a slightly updated color palette. This will mostly be noticeable inside the ice caves. \n\n\nFourthly, they will be updating the sound system and some lighting inside the ride. Similarly to the final scene of big thunder.  \n\n\nHe also said there will be a surprise. I have no idea if he was just pulling more leg or if he was serious. We just have to just wait and find out!

For now the data is updated every 20 minutes but I can make it update more often if needed.\n\n\nHere are the urls for each park if you want to experiment:\n\n\nCalifornia\n\n\n>Disneyland: \nhttp:\/\/dlwait.zingled.com\/dlp\n\n\n>California Adventure: \nhttp:\/\/dlwait.zingled.com\/dca\n\n\nFlorida\n\n\n>Magic Kingdom: \nhttp:\/\/dlwait.zingled.com\/mk\n\n\n>EPCOT: \nhttp:\/\/dlwait.zingled.com\/ep\n\n\n>Animal Kingdom: \nhttp:\/\/dlwait.zingled.com\/ak\n\n\n>Hollywood Studios: \nhttp:\/\/dlwait.zingled.com\/hs\n\n\nParis\n\n\n>Disneyland Paris: \nhttp:\/\/dlwait.zingled.com\/dlpp\n\n\n>Walt Disney Studios: \nhttp:\/\/dlwait.zingled.com\/wds\n\n\nPlease note, I maintain this API for myself.

  "title":"Idea: Toontown and Fantasyland Theater",
  "text":"Hello All,\n\n\nI don't particularly like the idea of turning Toontown into Star Wars Land. I love Star Wars, but I just can't see it fitting theme wise at that location. I would, however, like to see Toontown go. \n\n\nI would be interested in seeing an expansion similar to Disney World's Fantasyland expansion. The space for said expansion would come from Toontown and the Fantasyland Theather.\n\n\nBeauty and the Beast is my favorite Disney movie and I feel it's woefully under represented in Disneyland. With that in mind I'd like to see Toontown turned into a long street themed to resemble Belle's poor provincial town. Some things I'd want to see:\n\n\n*Beauty and the Beast themed Dark Ride - The Little Mermaid ride in DCA seems to have a pretty high Rider Per Hour, and I think Disneyland could use an attraction with high throughput. I've seen some pretty cool ideas for Beauty and the Beast rides on MiceChat and I don't have one of my own that would top those. However the ride gets implemented, I think Beast, Belle and Gaston are due for some Disneyland attention.\n\n\n*Disney Dining themed Dark Ride - I've had this idea kicking around in my head for a while. A dark ride that would combine many different Disney properties into a single ride. Lumiere as the host. Aurora\/Prince Phillip, Lady and the Tramp, The Incredibles etc. eating in the dining room. Chefs Goofy and Remy back in the kitchen full of cooking chaos. Timon, Pumba and the Rats from Ratatouille in an alley out back eating grubs and sifting through the garbage. They could do some pretty cool things with food smells too (similar to the oranges on Soarin). A new original song to go along with the ride would be pretty cool as well\n\n\n*A french themed eatery, but maybe not as fancy as Be Our Guest. Keeping with the provincial town theme I think it would be great to see some more rustic french themed foods.\n\n\n*I'm no designer but I'd think cobblestones, maybe a well or a fountain as a water feature. Baguette carts settling bread and cheese. Maybe ham and cheese sandwiches? Audio animatronics leaning out of upper story windows etc. Just a general french theme with a Disneyland twist. It shouldn't be \"Beauty and the Beast Land\", but rather use that as an inspiration.\n\n\nThe next part of the expansion would involve the Fantasyland Theater area. I don't have anything against this area in general, but with the new Royal Theater\/Hall area west of the castle I wonder if we can put something better here. My Idea would be for a Disneyland version of the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train. I haven't had an opportunity to ride it myself but it looks pretty cool. The biggest issues I see here are A) people maybe not wanting a second mine train roller coaster, B) available space and related to that C) Things getting too crowded in this area.\n\n\nOverall the park would lose two rides (Gadget Go Coaster and Car Toon Spin) and a theater, but would gain an E-ticket attraction and two new dark rides (one of which at least would have a high rider capacity). When I was at the park in February, both Matterhorn and Splash Mountain were closed, and the other major rides were really feeling the stress of not having those rides to suck up guests. Car Toon Spin usually has a pretty good line, but I've always felt like Gadget's is more or less a waste of space. Three new rides would go a long way to helping alleviate long wait times at other attractions.",

  "text":"My kids are 2 and 4 so not a day goes by without a Frozen reference.  I had an epiphany last night and thought that there is no way that Disney cannot add a permanent Frozen attraction sometime in the near future.  Pinocchio (added during the 1983 remodel) is generally thought to be just bad.  Mr. Toad's (while I love the ride) is based on a movie that's relatively obscure.  And Snow White was recently removed from WDW (though, admittedly, replaced with a Snow White roller coaster).\n\n\nMy prediction:  within the next two years, there's a 50% chance that Frozen replaces one of these, a 25% chance that Frozen replaces something else or is added as a new ride (in either Disneyland or DCA) and a 25% chance that no new Frozen attraction is added.\n\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n\nEDIT:  WOW, I'm pretty surprised at the number of down votes.  That's cool.  At least I (unintentionally) fostered some heated discussion on the matter.  For the record, I would truly hate if Frozen became part of Fantasyland.",

It will take a bit of an adjustment to come back to real life.  \n\n\nDisney is such a surreal experience.  There are so many things to do over the course of 5 days, and yet so little things to do. I find myself repeating some favorite things like Star Tours, Thunder Mountain, Cars racing ride, and avoiding some other areas \/ rides like main street (too crowded), pirates of caribbean (after 1-2 rides it becomes too monotonous), autopia (too boring), etc.  Individually the rides are mostly boring and monotonous, but collectively it is a very cool experience.  Waiting in lines is made more bearable by good smartphone coverage.\n\n\nAll in all had a great time, kind of miss the ambiance of Disneyland, and the immediate \"touristy\" area.  Being under constant visual and audio simulation is such a contrast from real life.\n\n\nAlso fell in love with the weather in Anaheim, but once leaving the area and seeing the LA traffic, reality sinks in at how terrible the area really would be to live in daily.\n\n\nAll in all a very jarring and contradictory experiences in both DLR and So Cal in general.

We left Fantasmic and stopped at the pin and other stores in the western town (sorry not to familiar with the names). After that we went to the carousel and went to grab the Camera and camcorder and noticed they were gone. Has anyone ever experienced anything with lost or stolen cameras?

  "title":"Full review of my first time visit.",
  "text":"First off thank you all for your help! For those of you who missed it here is a link to my previous post \nhttp:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Disneyland\/comments\/31xpgv\/i_am_going_to_disneyland_for_the_first_time_what\/\n. I had many people asking for a full review of each of the parks, so here it is. TL;dr at the bottom\n\n\nDisneyland\n\n\nWe arrived at the gate 10 minutes prior to park opening, which was perfect. No need to be there any earlier. The night before we had looked into Fastpasses and how they worked, so right as the park opened I went to Star Tours to get a Fastpass as they went to Space Mountain to get in line and I caught up with them. And from there we were always trying to time it just right that as soon as soon we could get another Fastpass we did and were able to avoid a lot of lines.\n\n\nAs far as rides go I very quickly realized that Disneyland is a Theme Park and not an Amusement Park. With me growing up with Six Flags and Worlds of Fun very few of the rides were not super over the top heart pounding exciting. However on this trip I grew to love the story telling aspect of many of the rides. \n\n\nWe ate lunch at Blue Bayou which if you can was an awesome experience. Very much puts you in the world of Pirates and New Orleans. However I wasn't super impressed with the staff there and expected them to be more in character. Had the staff been in character it would have taken it to a whole other level. \n\n\nAll in all we rode:\n\n\n\n\nSpace Mountain x2\n\n\nBuzz Lightyear\n\n\nStar Tours x2\n\n\nPirates of the Caribbean\n\n\nJungle Tours\n\n\nIndiana Jones\n\n\nThunder Mountain\n\n\nSplash Mountain\n\n\nTiki Room\n\n\nSnow White\n\n\nTeacups\n\n\nIt's a Small World\n\n\n\n\nFor those going for the first time I highly recommend looking into Fastpasses and how they work prior to getting to the park. And also accepting you will not get to the whole park in 1 day. Especially on a busier day. \n\n\nCalifornia Adventure\n\n\nAfter our long day at Disneyland we were a little slow moving and didn't get to the park until an hour and half after park opening. We followed the same process as the day before as I went to Cars to get a Fastpass and everyone else went to the Toy Story game and I met up with them. I'm sure it's not like this everyday, but Cars is the most popular ride in the park so get your Fastpasses early! We got our Fastpass at 9:20 a.m. and weren't able to use it until 5:30 p.m.\n\n\nWe ate lunch at Carthay Circle, while not a strong theme presence here the server was amazing and had a lot of fun with us. We got the World of Color package at the restaurant which consisted of a 3 course meal and VIP tickets to World of Color later that night. I highly recommend this, it only cost 39 dollars per person which I felt was very reasonable for what we got. \n\n\nLater that night we did something we didn't get to do at Disneyland, walk into some of the shops and places. We found an amazing building that had a Talking with Crush exhibit, drawing class were we learned how to sketch Tigger and my favorite was going into to meet Anna and Elsa from Frozen. While I wasn't a particular fan of the movie the Cast Members playing them were amazing. Anna was spot on, talking my ear off about ice cream with Elsa behind me giving her sister an annoyed face. Just what I expected the sisters would really be like. \n\n\nThat night we returned for our World of Color show, which was possibly the best part of either of the parks. With an amazing light and pyrotechnic show that you absolutely shouldn't miss if you are there. \n\n\nAll in all we rode:\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Screamin x4\n\n\nTower of Terror x2\n\n\nToy Story x2\n\n\nCars\n\n\nGrizzly Run River\n\n\n\n\nCars was my favorite ride because it was a amazing balance of storytelling and ride (with fast drops and turns). Tower of Terror was a very close second and would have been first had our bell hops been all in for the performance.\n\n\nI absolutely had a blast but If we did it again I would get a 1 day Disneyland ticket and a 1 day park hopper ticket so I could spend half of the day in California Adventure and half in Disneyland. \n\n\nWhat was most disappointing was some notable rides closures, including Matterhorn, Peter Pan, and California Soaring. While I understand it is going to happen, it felt over the top with all three on such a busy week. Secondly was that not all Cast Members capitalized on their roles. The few that I came across who were, completely changed the experience. \n\n\nTL;dr\n Disneyland and California Adventure are theme parks not amusement parks. Don't forget to use Fastpasses.",

Are times still not posted yet for any shows like Magical Map and parades, or are they just not doing any that week? I see a few things are up (Jedi training and Royal Theatre) but is the park devoid of the larger entertainment that week in prep for the new parade\/fireworks? I'd love to catch Magical Map and the Soundsational Parade if they're running. I've seen conflicting info on maybe one show that week for Magical Map (maybe on Thurs or Friday, can't remember where I saw that though), but nothing in the rest of the week.\n\n\nAnother question - I have a dinner reservation at River Belle to get the reserved seating FastPass for Fantasmic on the 22nd. Never seen the show and I'm excited for it, but as the times for the new parade and Disneyland Forever have been coming out it seems like they all overlap. From what I've read, Paint the Night runs at 8:50, Fantasmic starts at 9:00, and Disneyland Forever starts at 9:30. \n\n\nI doubt there's going to be any way to see the parade AND make it to Fantasmic, which is disappointing that we might not see any parades that week. But what are the chances we could catch Fantasmic and head to the hub or Main St from the river in time to see the projections for the Forever show? I'm sure we could see the fireworks just fine from Fantasmic, but I'm kind of pumped to see the full show with projections. From the preview videos I've seen on YouTube it looks pretty awesome. I know it'll be cutting it really close trying to head back to the hub\/Main St, and with a bazillion people at the park that day (plus everyone still hanging around from the parade) I can't imagine it's going to be easy moving around after the show, since most everyone else watching Fantasmic will probably have the same idea. (I believe there's also a second showing of Fantasmic that night but there's just no way the kids will be able to stay awake for that.) Any ideas\/suggestions are certainly appreciated!\n\n\nI'm a tad disappointed that all the nighttime shows are lumped so close together. I'm guessing they're expecting people watching the parade to sit tight and just wait for the Disneyland Forever show to start. I wish they would do an extra Fantasmic showing or two during the week (especially since they seem to be devoid of major entertainment leading up to the 24 hour event); we'd totally hit one of those up and be able to enjoy the brand new stuff too. Either way though, we're super excited for the trip!",

  "text":"I personally love ToonTown and like going there, but I also feel awkward because I really can't do allot there and it is more nostalgic than anything.   The reason I'm bringing this up is that it's been brought up by many users on this forum and on many Disney blogs that ToonTown has the lowest crowd retention and attendance of any of the other lands in Disneyland, with many citing the lack of sit-down restaurants, the majority of attractions aimed for small children\/small children and one or two parents, and attractions that the entire family can enjoy. And for several years now, there have been rumors of Disney executives removing ToonTown in favor of a Star Wars land extending into Tomorrowland. However, as that would not only be illogical but awkward placing of the land as it would then have to wind between Fantasyland to reach Tomorrowland, it makes more sense to change the land into an entirely new area of the park.\n\n\nBut what do you guys think: do you guys think Disney should remove ToonTown and, if so, what would you like to see there? \n\n\nPersonally, I would like a version of New Fantasyland but with Lion King, Aladdin, Lilo and Stitch,  Atlantis, and other   attractions from overlooked films. Also, we need a Mystic Manor in the United States. :)\n\n\nedit: Also for those worrying about Roger Rabbit Car Toon Spin, there is also a rumour going around that Holllywood Land in California Adventure could be changed to another Toonland and Roger Rabbit would be moved over there.",

I have looked over many sites that try to gauge park crowds and haven't been able to really find specific answers pertaining to crowds and Fast Passes.\n\n\nThe last time we went to Disney was over 6 years ago on our honeymoon, and there was no such thing as Fast Pass. We went during the middle of January and really had no issues going from ride to ride during our visit. \n\n\nI believe our visit window will be on the lower side of crows (M-F during the school year). I am hoping our experience will be similar to our previous visit. While we would like to be at the park as early as possible, I know that most likely won't happen. I am hoping that people can share some first hand experience for me.\n\n\nHow will the crowds be? Will there be a need to get Fast Passes for everything? While we have park hoppers, we would prefer to stay in one park mostly and limit our travel time. \n\n\nAlso, we plan to have an eating at Ariels Grotto. Is it better to go for a breakfast or for a lunch? What are the thoughts and feelings about the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique? \n\n\nAny other tips and tricks would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks!",

  "text":"So, this isn't really so much a park related question inasmuch as just a transportation question, but since DL is my start point I thought this might be the best place to ask. \n\n\nI'm heading to Disneyland with my son in three weeks and spending 3 days\/nights there, and then I want to spend 1 day in Long Beach so I can take him to the Aquarium of the Pacific. I booked our flights to land and depart in Orange County, so getting to the park will be simple. \n\n\nBUT, looking at taxi fare calculators, it would cost about $100 to go from DL to the Queen Mary, where we're staying our last night in CA. There are shuttles that go from the park to the Long Beach airport, but between the cost of the shuttles I've seen and then another cab to the Queen Mary it'll still cost close to $100. \n\n\nWe can take the bus, but I'm sure the other passengers just love people with luggage taking up space and whatnot. It also takes a couple of hours. \n\n\nIs anyone here familiar with the public transportation in the area or had similar issues when traveling to Disneyland and nearby? Are there other options I should be looking for?",

  "title":"Question about DAS card",
  "text":"Hello all! Using a throwaway because I'll be listing some personal information about myself. I've been a loyal Disneyland Annual Pass holder for about 7 years now! Disneyland has always been really accommodating with my \"issues\". I have a panic disorder, socialized anxiety disorder, and agoraphobia. My doctor always told me to try and push myself, and so my mom thought going to places like Disneyland, which I love, would help push me and really try to improve. When we found out about the disabled assist cards and everything, it was perfect for those days when I was having a hard time and began to get restless. Ive been in a good place recently and I haven't been using the cards that often, but last time I went (my birthday, woo!) I was having a hard time with the crowds. My boyfriend and went to get fast passes but the rides we went to were for the evening, and because of the situation we were in, I wasn't going to stay for very long. \n\n\nSo we go to one of the places to get the DAS card, and the girl there is very sweet but can't help me as her device to issue me a new one would not cooperate with her, which was understandable. So, we went to the guest services center in CA. The woman who helped us there asked me the usual questions of what my needs were. I told her that I have anxiety and get restless and sometimes end up leaving the line because I've been standing still for too long or that it's too cramped. I told her I've used the service before and have no problem waiting the wait time, I am just so glad that I can wait outside and move around and take a breath. She then told me that she could not issue one and that she could not help me. She then said that I shouldn't go on rides that cause me to \"freak out\". I don't like talking about my problem, it's embarrassing to me and so I was already starting to be uncomfortable but with her saying that I broke down. I thanked her, and walked outside and straight for the bathrooms where I immediately started crying. This is not me being emotional or trying to get sympathy, i'm merely explaining what happened. I get frustrated with my anxiety and when I get frustrated, I cry. So there I was crying, and my boyfriend was outside stewing. I was ready to throw in the towel and just go home, I was embarrassed and I was uncomfortable. The first girl had given us a re-admittance card for a ride in Disneyland, so we went over there to ride the ride and then go home.\n\n\nMy boyfriend pushed me to seek out another CM to help, and so we approached a girl and told her that I had used the DAS card before and had wondered if anything had changed, as it had expired and did it apply to my situation? She told me that I should let the CMs know that I don't usually stay long enough to use the fast passes (as we usually only stay for 2 hours) and\/or have someone stay in line while I wait outside and then enter after they reach the front (which i've tried and does not work well at all). I was so upset that day, although she did help us and we rode a few rides in the end, but I feel like what's the point in going to Disneyland anymore, if I feel like within an hour I'll end up wanting to go home?\n\n\nDoes the DAS card really not apply to people in my situation, or is there a different way I should explain my situation?",

  "title":"My 3ish day plan. Advice please!",
  "text":"We are planning a trip for early February 2016. It will be at the tail end of some other west-coast shenanigans (we are in New England), then leaving out of LAX (or Orange, depending on the deals). My three kids are 12, 9, and 6, and we haven't done Disney in any form yet. Although Fl may be closer, I think CA is more my speed. Also, crowds in February in FL are crazy. Keep in mind, I have not committed (ie bought) to anything, so it's all flexible. Are reservations at most six months out? I can only reserve into December now. When will be the best time to book? Are there generally deals that I can hold out for?\n\n\nRight now the plan is to arrive on a Tuesday night. I'm thinking we will stay at the Grand Californian - since we will probably only do this once, I'd like to stay somewhere nice, comfortable, and close. Besides, the magic mornings will be worth it. I do appreciate a good deal, though, so convince me.  Are there places at the GC that we can watch the evening shows? I'm assuming that the upgrade to \"club level\" isn't worth the $300\/night. We will have snacks and I'm thinking we eat one light meal (corn dogs, etc) in the park, and then a dinner. I think if I did the club level, I'd feel like we needed to eat most of our meals there, and could miss out on some of the park fun. I think we can eat pretty well for less than that $300. In terms of dining - we eat plenty of good food, I'm not necessarily looking for an amazing meal, but something fun and disneyish, so I've put the Big Thunder BBQ on the list - any other similar recommendations? No one is super into characters, so I'm not convinced we need any character meals.\n\n\nWhen we arrive Tuesday night, what is our best bet for getting right into the magic, especially since we won't have park tickets that day. It may be early evening - let's say 4:00. Is Downtown Disney our best bet? Will we be able to see any shows or other excitement?\n\n\nNext, I'm thinking Wednesday, Thursday and Friday in the parks. Is a park hopper worth it?  Tell me more about how to do the parks. I'm hoping that we can hit the magic mornings for the big stuff (Radiator Springs, etc.) first thing, then not so much plan the rest. As a family, we like to do morning activities, afternoon quiet\/pool time, and then evening activities. Does that make sense? I'm hoping by doing weekdays, crowds will be lower. But I hear Friday night has a lot of the magic going on, what will that get us?\n\n\nThe youngest child is SUPER into the avengers\/super heros\/marvel. Is there any of that still around? He does like Star Wars, so I know he'll appreciate any of that - tell me what to hit for him. The 12 year old is not a character kid, but I'm sure he'll like the rides. 9 year old is a girl but has never been a princess kid. Everyone is fine with walking a lot, even the little guy. We won't have a stroller, but in terms of gear - water bottles? How warm will it be? We will be able to swim, right? Keep in mind, we are from the frozen North, we will swim at 72.\n\n\nSaturday morning - I'm guessing our flights will be afternoon, so if any time, this would be our character breakfast time. Worth it, especially for kids not into characters much? Can we play this by ear? Anything else that you'd recommend, without having a park ticket this day?\n\n\nOh, the other thing I wanted to ask about were tips\/secrets. Things like the Lilly Belle (which is on my list now because of this sub). Only my husband has been to the parks before so I think we will all get \"first-timer\" buttons (this is a thing, right?).

  "text":"My school is going on a full-day (8 am to 12 pm) trip to both DL and CA on June 1st. My group is me and my 2 friends. I know a lot about the parks and they have \"common knowledge\" (but they have experience). \n\n\nThe plan is to go in a counter clockwise circle. We're starting in Tomorrowland. This is the order of the rides we're going on. \n\n\n-Space Mountain\n\n\n-Star Tours\n\n\n-Buzz Lightyear\n\n\n-Matterhorn\n\n\n-Thunder Mountain\n\n\n-Haunted Mansion \n\n\n-Pirates \n\n\n-Indiana Jones\n\n\n-Jungle Cruise\n\n\nAt this point we head over to CA.\n\n\n-Tower of Terror\n\n\n-Radiator Springs\n\n\n-Screamin\n\n\n-(This is wear I would put Soarin but it'll be closed) \n\n\nAt night we plan on watching the 60th fireworks and the new parade\n\n\nNotes: \n\n\n-of course we will do some light shopping and we will stop to eat when we are hungry (lunch and dinner only) \n\n\n-students are not required to meet with adults at any point of the day. We just need to be on the bus after the park closes. \n\n\n-I couldn't really think of any more rides to do in CA. I will happily take suggestions. \n\n\n-I figured we could do half and half on parks and if we have extra time we can just do more rides or just look around. \n\n\n-I have considered taking out the fireworks and parade just so we can do more stuff, because I could really go without seeing them.\n\n\n-my friends know how much I know Disneyland. They said that they'd prefer if I planned the day out :)",

  "text":"Hello, we have recently returned from our visit to Disneyland Park and Resort. We used the Disability Access System for my autistic 9 year old son who has difficulty waiting in lines\n.\nTo be frank, it could use alot of work.\n\n\n*A sheet of printed instructions would be extremely helpfull. It is next to impossible to understand the explinations while you are standing in city hall trying to control a child who is eager to get out and explore.\n\n\n*Some sort of warning before hand that -everyone- in your party must be present at city hall to start the process. We had planned to just send myself in the child in to get the pass, while the rest of the family starting to experience the park. \n\n\n*We were then told that our whole party must be present. We then had to stop; find everyone, and drag them in.\n\n\n*There's some inconsistency among cast members about how the pass works. Many times we went to the exit\/wheel chair entrance, presented our disability access ticket and got on. Other times we were told we need to come back with a return time. (Got on just fine at jungle cruise, storybook village, autotopia. Was turned away at small world and gadget's go coaster among others)\n\n\n\n\nWe only figured out we needed to enter through the exit by watching another family do so. No one told us about this.\n\n\n\n\nHaving some sort of similair system for food lines would be extremely helpful as well. Autistic children have trouble waiting in lines for this as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it did work, it was wonderful and made our experience so much more enjoyable. It was nice to bypass the lines without having to worry about our son getting frustrated and acting out The system is just not explained well once you get into the park, and it's not done with any consistency.",

  "text":"I'm far enough away from Disneyland that I won't get to go until December, at the earliest, so I wanted to watch all the new shows online. I found pretty good YouTube videos of them, and I was curious how others feel about the new shows. \n\n\nFireworks: \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rmkZ-JENQzU\n\n\nI like the new fireworks a lot! I really enjoyed the projections along Main Street and the blow up seaweed stuff during Little Mermaid, that's an awesome addition. I like that Mary Poppins and the Lion King got some love, I feel like they're rather underrepresented at the park sometimes. I've always enjoyed Disneyland fireworks (except for the dinky 4 minute show they had going while working on the new show, that was disappointing). I miss aspects of the \"Remember\" show, mainly the Haunted Mansion segment, but this new one is really great too. I like it a lot!\n\n\nWorld of Color: \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WK38wHBNOJM&feature=youtu.be\n\n\nI didn't like it a whole lot. There were things missing from the old show, but I really enjoyed hearing classic songs and seeing the animation on the water and with lasers and fire and stuff. I like that Screamin' is more used in the new show, the lights on it at the beginning were especially impressive. I get why they brought in Neil Patrick Harris to \"host\" since this show seems to need a little hosting, but I would've much preferred more of the old WOC to the song they had him sing. The flashes of clips from movies was a little too fast it felt, and I'm disappointed that the one Disney song still included is \"Let it Go.\" I understand why it's included, but I'm disappointed, especially since they also include it in the Fireworks show. This new show does a great job of being visually impressive, and I like that it feels like a tribute to Walt, but I just don't feel the desire to see it live like I did with the other show. The other show I watched every time I made it down to the park for a few days. This one I can see myself watching once, and then not seeing again. Maybe one of the reasons for this is that for me, one of my favorite things about Disney is the music. I love the songs that I recognize and want to sing along with from all the movies, and that's what I enjoyed about the previous show. This show is missing that, so to me, it feels like it lacks heart, except for the sections that tribute Walt. \n\n\nPaint the Night: \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mDGDTpAipzw\n\n\nThis is such a visually gorgeous parade. The costumes are gorgeous! I also like that it seemed a little faster paced than \"Soundsational.\" I liked the little tiny reference to the Electrical Light Parade, but it wasn't enough for me. I wish there would've been a little bit more like that. Ariel's float was gorgeous! Slinky dog will always have a special place in my heart (I had a dachshund named Slinky), so I was glad to see him as the main part of the Toy Story float, and the eyes were really cool on him. The princess float was really cool too! I loved the big rose behind Belle. Her dress was impressive, but I'm not sure how I feel about that decision. It just made her look really awkward and stiff. The Frozen float was really gorgeous. I'm not usually a huge fan of parades, but this is definitely one that I'll watch the next time I'm there. \n\n\nWhat does everyone else think about the new shows?",

She's usually a content baby when we walk around in the stroller. I spend a few hours at ikea from time to time and she loves it. She's not too scared of big crowds because of how much stuff we do.

He liked it fine but didn't think it was that amazing, which I believe has to do with the fact that he didn't experience the magic as a kid. Then, we went a couple years after with our first two kids. He had terrible sciatic pain the whole time and that made it hard for him to enjoy the trip. We are going again in Sept and he is having THE LAMEST attitude about it! He's not being a total punk, but he's certainly not excited.\n\n\nMeanwhile, I AM THRILLED! I love Disneyland and I tear up at just the thought of my kids (will be 6 and 3.5) being caught up in the wonder. My husband's opinion of the whole thing is like a dark cloud over my excitement, and I keep stressing about spending all this money (I've been saving for a while) on something he doesn't even want to do.\n\n\nAll that is to say...Any suggestions for \"Disney-lite\" things that he may enjoy? Off the beaten path, slower pace...Anything like that? He is cynical and doesn't enjoy the \"magic\" of it all, but he appreciates how well run the parks are. \/eye roll",

  "title":"My trip to Disney California Adventure.",
  "text":"I went with my sister on the 9th for my birthday and it was awesome. It was the first time being there in 6 years and it was better than I remembered. Just wanted to share a few highlights from my trip: \n\n\n1.On Grizzly River Run an old man sitting across from me says \"Imma put my hat on so my hair doesn't wet.\" With every drop he gets more drenched than anybody and I'm laughing throughout the entire ride. 2. Accidentally stumbling upon a fastpass for Radiator Springs. 3. The first time I went to DCA I was too scared to go on the swinging part of Mickey's Fun Wheel. This time I decide to face my fears and as soon it slides back I'm screaming harder than I've ever screamed in my life. When I think its over I breathe a sigh of relief, but then it goes around for a 2nd time, and just as I'm starting to get used to it the ride ends. 4. At the Frozen Sing-Along show I expect the whole audience to sing. I start singing before the first sing-along part even starts when at the beginning it plays that one song that goes \"HENYA HENYA HENYA HENYA HE!!!!\" People starin at me like \"Da Hell?\" Throughout every song me and my sister are singing at the top of our lungs, I'm even doing every hand movement and throwing my grey buff in the air during Let It Go, and I kid you not we're basically the only ones singing. When it was over I couldn't stop smiling. Then went to meet Olaf and hugged him so hard I think I might've damaged the costume. 5. I go to the Wilderness Explorer area and have way more fun 19 year old boy should. I was going down the slides, going through the rope bridges on all 4's, felt like a little kid lol. 6. Got lost about 10 times trying to get out of Paradise Pier. 7. Accidentally slide my card in a out order game at Paradise Pier, the lol's ensue. 8. Hear the Pixar Parade going on after getting off California Screamin. I hightail it,  BOOM Sonic the Hedgehog style! I'm cruisin through Paradise Pier. I don't even know if my sister is following behind, but there's no way I'm missing any of the parade. I'm sweating pretty hard by the time I get there, but then a miracle happens, it starts to rain to cool me off. So if you were there on the 9th and saw a guy in red shirt with a grey buff on his head running through Paradiser Pier, it was me. 9. We end up going back to the Frozen Sing-Along at around 9pm. It isn't as full as the first time we went probably due the first World of Color showing. I make sure to snag a front row seat this time. Again we're singing at the top of lungs, and to our surprise more people in the audience are singing. This audience was about half as the size as the first time we went, but there were more people actually singing in this one. At the end of the show during the 2nd Let It Go, Kristoff looks at us and said \"Oh you guys came back?! 2 times! (gives thumbs up)\" Dude looked like RJ Mitte from Breaking Bad. That made my day cause we were in like the 6th row the first time we went and I could tell none of the other actors were really looking at the audience. Him saying that really shocked me. 10. The World of Color was awesome. When Neil Patrick Harris came out I lierally shouted \"OMG ITS NEIL PATRICK HARRIS!\" I still have his song from it stuck in my head. When it showed the montage of all the movies I started crying actual tears. \n\n\nOverall my experience was legendary. Now, why am I sharing this with you? Because it in all honesty was the most fun I've had in a while, I literally couldn't stop smiling my entire time there. I think I forgot to mention that everyone around me was also a highlight of my experience. Every conversation with the workers and other guest, you meet some pretty interesting and amazing people. I think I might end up buying an annual pass. And to all those who managed to get through my entire post \nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/zh6MJzR.gifv",

I go to Disneyland pretty often for someone who lives two states away, but not often enough to know about specific times of the year.\n\n\nThis year we are going the first week of November (the 2nd-8th), right after Halloween.  I know they will be taking down some decorations and putting up Christmas ones soon, but I wasn't sure what to expect.  Crowd estimates are pretty low for that week (I'm guessing because people don't want to see Halloween decorations after Halloween is over). Also, if anyone knows, what rides are typically down that week?  I know they probably close Space Mountain to take out the Ghost Galaxy overlay, but how long does that take?  And do they also close Small World right after Halloween to install the Christmas version?  It's my mom's favorite ride so I'm hoping there is at least a couple days after Halloween where it's still running!\n\n\nSorry for all the questions, or if these have been answered elsewhere (I'm still learning how reddit works). We're just really excited to see all the new stuff for the 60th and whatnot.",

Not sure what to expect on a \"normal\" summer Friday.\n\n\nEdit:  For those interested the park was quite nice on Friday.  We arrived at the gates at 8:00 and had maybe a 5 minute wait to get past the turnstyles.  We went to FantasyLand first and knocked out Alice in Wonderland, Mr. Toad, Snow White and Pinocchio plus the Matterhorn and Rodger Rabbit with a side trip to Mickey Mouse's house in the first hour.\n\n\nWe then slowed down and took the train to New Orleans for Haunted mansion and Pirates while getting fast passes for Indiana Jones.  Then off to Thunder Mountain and to visit the goats.\n\n\nThe rest of the day got crowded, and we slowed down only wanting to hit Space Mountain and star tours.  We had dinner at about 7:00 so we could watch paint the night and the fireworks from main street, where it got REALLY crowded, like New Years Eve crowded.  After the fireworks we did a bit of shopping then headed home.",

This will create an effect similar to being flushed down a toilet. You're essentially tricking your inner ear into interpreting the G-forces a different kind of way. A lot of people that do it sit in the back of the train as it pulls harder, enhancing the effect.\n\n\nI hope this post has hopefully taught you something new to try the next time you're on BTMRR!",

We drove down in the morning and stayed from noon until 10 with a baby! She enjoyed every second of it and took naps in the stroller. She rode a few rides and didn't  cry until we left. It seems to me like she really enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean. Unfortunately, we couldn't time it just right to meet characters. We almost met Donald Duck and she got to see Goofy for a few minutes. I thought she would have been scared of them, but she loved it! The worst part about it was the drive there and back. The drive there had quite a bit of traffic because of construction. It added about 45 minutes to our drive time. Even worse than that was the drive home. We live in Bakersfield so we take the 99 to the I-5. I wish I would have paid attention to the northbound closures for the I-5 because it was down to one lane by 11pm. Traffic was heaviest by the LA zoo exits. It picked up a little bit after we got into Burbank.

Cast Members will be looking for any sort of extension pole with an attachment for any kind of camera or mobile device -- this presumably includes monopods and grips as well, even small ones.\n\n\nThere will be signs all over the outside of the resort -- including within the Mickey and Friends Parking Structure and other parking lots -- informing guests of the ban. Additionally, as guests park they will receive a slip informing them that they should not bring their selfie sticks with them into the park. The Mickey and Friends tram will receive an updated portion of its spiel telling incoming guests that they cannot bring the sticks inside the park.\n\n\nSelfie sticks will be screened for at the security bag check. If one is found, the guest will be asked to return it to their hotel room or car. If the guest cannot do so, Guest Relations will tag the selfie stick and put it into storage for the guest to pick up as they leave the park. If a Cast Member catches a guest using a selfie stick inside of the park, that guest will be escorted to Guest Relations so that they may tag and store the selfie stick.\n\n\nAs always, Cast Members will be more than happy to help take pictures for you, so long as there are no safety concerns. Any CM can take a picture with your own personal cell phone or camera, even if that CM is carrying their own camera. All you need to do is ask -- Photopass CMs seriously don't mind if you want to take a picture on your phone or camera instead of theirs, and any other Cast Member will be happy to assist so long as they are free to do so.\n\n\nPlease follow proper \nreddiquette\n and don't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.\n\n\nThank you!",

The movie is a \nhuge\n success. \n\n\nWhen Frozen came out, people would \nnot\n shut up about it. It was everywhere. I thought it was pretty good. But nothing spectacular.

However, Inside Out is a movie about psychology, and going threw rough things in your life. Honestly, do kids even like this movie? It has a good amount of funny parts and the characters are bright and colorful. But the movie is \nreally\n sad. It might not fit in with the happy vibe of the park, (which would probably be California Adventure because it's Pixar). There might not be anywhere to put it because it doesn't fit in anywhere. \n\n\nI find this really sad because I really liked the movie but I guess I can understand why Disneyland might not capitalize on its success.\n\n\nPut it this way, if you're the \naverage person\n, would you really want to go see something in the parks about Inside Out? Going to see it might just make you sad again. \n\n\nHowever, I keep my faith in Disney because they've done amazing things before and I hope they do it again.",

  "text":"So, I just read about the wage increase in Los Angeles to $15 by 2018(?). That's awesome news, especially in a place with such a high cost of living.\n\n\nI read that Disneyland isn't effect by this because they are in a different county. Is that true? And if so, has Disney said anything about matching these wages? If they haven't, is there any sort of talk amongst cast members about leaving Disney for better wages?\n\n\nI am a FL cast member, and we just had a wage hike ad WDW last year that will finish in Jan. We are going up to $10, currently at $9.50. With cost of living differences, its probably not that far off from $15 over in LA.",

I\u2019m hoping someone (A CM?) may have an answer for this.\n\n\nI was seated on Space Mountain, about to go into the second stop, facing the control room before you start again and head up the incline. While sitting there, two CMs pulled up a staircase on wheels next to the ride, one of them stepped on some sort of break, and they proceeded to remove two people out from the ride. It was clear that these people did something wrong, as the cast members were very firm in telling them to exit the ride. It was weird because they were two teenagers, with other family members, and the family members didn\u2019t seem to understand why the teens were getting pulled off. The CMs were definitely not playing around, too, and kinda pushed the two teens off to a side room.\n\n\nI guess what I\u2019m asking is, what could a guest do to warrant being pulled off of a ride, after they\u2019re already seated and the ride has started moving? Maybe they stole something and the camera followed them all the way to the ride? Is that even possible lol? Or maybe they cut the line (but this didn\u2019t seem obvious because they were with other family members)? \n\n\nAnd for Non-CMs, have you ever seen this happen before?

  "title":"Disney and Imagineering Timetables",
  "text":"With the recent announcements of additions and upgrades coming to many Disney parks here in the near future I think now is the perfect time to have a discussion about the current Imagineering time table. At least we can have a conversation from the perspective that we can see as guests who follow this stuff as closely as we can. A rational conversation that won\u2019t get too wrapped up in emotion, can we do that?\n\n\nThis past week\u2019s announcement that the entrance tax and subsequent $1 Billion dollar expenditures was awesome to hear from this Disney fan\u2019s perspective. There are a few areas inside Disneyland that need a bit of an update. Cough, Toon Town, Cough, Tomorrowland, Cough. There are many different avenues Disney could walk down in order to either update or completely remove and replace some of these areas. The budget being as big as it\u2019s been announced shows that they are not planning on holding back either which is awesome. It just goes to show how much they value their parks and the storytelling that they can do through them. \n\n\nSo, why am I upset? Great question and I hope you can find the answer within these next few paragraphs. Simply put, Disney\u2019s Imagineering department has become slow. I don\u2019t know if they are mired by bureaucracy within the company or if they simply have so many ideas that they require time to work through them, but some of their more recent projects just seem to drag on forever.  The recent renovation and creation of \u201cNew Fantasyland\u201d at Walt Disney World took almost 5 years from announcement to completion. Almost five whole years! I\u2019ve visited New Fantasyland on a couple of occasions since completion and while I love the elements they have created and true to their worth, the Imagineering and storytelling are amazing. But there isn\u2019t anything there that really says to me, \u201cOh, I see why that element took 5 years to complete.\u201d In fact, one of the rides in New Fantasyland is a direct copy and paste from a ride that already existed at California Studios. \n\n\nKeep in mind that Disney redoing Fantasyland was somewhat in response to Universal opening Harry Potter World. So, you would think that they would be working a bit harder to get these rides and the area going as soon as possible to compete with their rival across town. Want to know how long it took Universal to complete that Harry Potter upgrade? Two and a half years to three years depending on how you count it. We\u2019re talking about almost half the amount of time that Disney took to complete their upgrades. Many people will tell you as well that Universal didn\u2019t skimp either. They created a world that is interactive and had a ride that was pretty inventive created and put in place in that amount of time. It\u2019s not like they were cutting corners.\n\n\nSpeaking of cutting corners, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking Disney or Imagineering to do here. Like I\u2019ve said many times and will repeat until I die, the charm that Imagineering has going for it is its story telling ability. Joe Rohde is absolutely one of my favorite people and inspirations for what he has been able to do with the Animal Kingdom. You visit that park and you are immediately transported to wherever he wants you to be. Whether that be Africa, Asia, or a parking lot carnival he and his team did an astounding job of pulling the elements together to make everything shine. \n\n\nI\u2019m also one hundred percent positive that when Avatarland finishes sometime around 2017 or 2018 that it will blow anything Universal has done out of the water. But at that point we will have waited 6 or 7 years for this new area to come to fruition. That\u2019s an eternity in park development terms. I find it hard to believe that they could not have the quality they strive for at a faster pace. Just look at that $1 Billion promised to go to work in Disneyland. It\u2019s July of 2015 and they are saying that the park won\u2019t even BEGIN construction until 2017! Then who knows how many years from then that it will finally be finished. Come on Disney, you can do better than that. We all know you can.\n\n\nTL:DR\n: Disney should be able to complete their high quality work in a shorter amount of time.",

  "title":"Autopia needs updating![Tomorrowland]",
  "text":"Been thinking about how Disney could improve this attraction and that's by getting rid of gasoline powered vehicles for starters. I can't stand the fumes no more than a few minutes before I start feeling nauseous.\n\n\nAlso, this attraction is part of \"Tomorrowland\" in which it fails at many levels. If people knew better, gas combustion engines are no longer the future. This is the case where Disney should REALLY consider getting in talks with the electric car company, TESLA. First I want to be clear, I do not work for them, but I do appreciate how TESLA has grown and improved over the years and TESLA'S vehicles aren't going away. Think about it, mini electric Tesla models on Autopia, wouldn't that be awesome? Not only would electric motor vehicles improve the environment; this could also save Disney's attraction. Plus, the learning curve on electric motors and learning about our inventor, Nikola Tesla (the father of AC) would be much more interactive while waiting. I don't know, whether 10, 30 or 50 years from now if this ride will still exist, but Disney needs to move forward and upgrade this attraction stat if it wants to keep it going toward the future.\n\n\nMy resentment for this attraction grows each day as I know Disney can overhaul this attraction and make it better, but kickbacks from Chevron and advertising do not make me want to pump gas into my car anymore. Autopia is completely outdated and a dead attraction to me and I will not bring my future family\/kids anywhere near.",

This time, though, instead of trying to do it as cheaply as possible, I get to go all out (not really, but there's much more wiggle room)\n\n\nSo here's the deal.\n\n\n\n\nTrip will be me, my SO, my mom, and my sister (all adults over 21, though not big drinkers or anything)\n\n\n\n\n3 days in the parks (definitely park hoppers), probably 5 nights in a hotel\n\n\n\n\nSat, Sun, Mon or Sun, Mon, Tues schedule - looking for most hours per day and I know the Halloween party will mess things up.

Q: the Disneyland website won't let me choose more than one room, unless it's a suite. Help? Was planning on calling to make the reservation anyway.\n\n\n\n\nDon't think we want to do a Halloween party. Thought about it, but not sure. None of us have been. (I had tickets last year, then my dad died, so I had to cancel)\n\n\n\n\nDefinitely WOC dinner tickets. SO and I did Ariel's Grotto in 2010 and it was meh.

  "text":"Hello! I've been lurking the sub for the past few days to prepare for my trip to DLP And DCA. I'm going for two days with park hopper tickets. I had questions on fastpasses, food, and merch questions. It will just be me at the park, so no kids to worry about or anyone else. \n\n\nFirst, Fastpasses, are they hard to get in this park versus WDW? I would like to hit up Pirates, Haunted Mansion, Matterhorn, Soaring, California Screamin', Space Mountain, Big Thunder Rail Road, and Star Tours. Some of these have Fastpasses but some don't I believe. What ones usually sell out first for Fastpasses? Should I skip any Fastpasses for these? I've been on Space Mountain, Big Thunder Rail Road and the Haunted Mansion in WDW, would you say it's better to try to get Fastpasses to the other rides over these ones? Or are these rides similar but unique to this specific location?\n\n\nNow the next thing I really want to do is meet characters. I was able to meet a few in WDW, but not as many as I hoped. I saw Else and Anna have Fastpasses for their character meet, and I wondered how hard those are to get. I was thinking probably the first place I should go in DCA if I want to see them. Also, where are the general locations for other characters? Where do you usually find them? I would love to see Peter Pan, the princesses, and of course Mickey and Minnie. Other characters are a bonus as well, but these are my main focus. \n\n\nI planned on bringing a reasonable sized backpack to carry around. At WDW I only had a purse since we were staying on the resort, but this is not the case this year. How are backpacks handled when you go on thrill rides? If I want to bring a water bottle of my own do they allow that? Or does the water bottle have to be unopened before entering the park? I planned on bringing snacks in case I get hungry, I might do a few quick services meals or maybe a nice sit down. \n\n\nI am terribly addicted to those damn tsum tsums, and I know they are in Downtown Disney, but what specific store are they located in? I will certainly be hitting up those when I go. (I have a problem) I want to get some cool 60th anniversary stuff, too, but I figured that can be found all around the parks. \n\n\nThanks for all the help, and I'm too excited for this trip to come!

Growing up, I always assumed that ride had been Space Mountain, but after watching \nFreshBakedDisney's Secrets and History of Space Mountain\n, I'm not so sure. \n\n\nThe only thing I really remember about this ride was that there was a lot of red involved and it was at least semi-fast. I believe I went on this ride in 2000, if that is relevant. \n\n\nAny help is appreciated! \n\n\nEdit\n: Thanks everyone for the help!

Last time I visited Disneyland was on June 29th of this year and the next day I left for vacation trip to Door Country Wisconsin. I returned to California on July 11 after that, I was very busy visiting families\/ relatives around California and I planned to go to Disneyland on July 28th but my day was ruined. Disneyland tickets aren't refundable which is very STUPID and pretty much my money went down the drain for a billionaire company. I called Disney Customer Service after I left the park, the cast member felt very sorry for me and was upset also because my ticket was expired. I had 3 days left and their gone. I asked her if I can get a refund but unfortunately it was impossible. SO I hope Disney really changes their policies about expiration dates. Tickets should be expire if haven't used in 2 years, not days!",

We have decided to do the Photopass Plus and do a dinner at Goofy's Kitchen, but we have a couple of other questions we can't seem to get answers on:\n\n\n\n\nOut of Carthay Circle, Ariels Grotto, and Wine Country Tretorria, which has the best value for World of Color dining package? As in good food for price and viewing location for the WoC?\n\n\n\n\nAs two adults and a toddler we are planning on doing rider swap a lot. We have heard from some sources online that you can use one fast pass to enter a ride and get a stroller swap pass for the other adult with the other adult getting a fast pass for a different ride (one fast pass needed per ride via stroller swap) is this true? For instance my wife gets a fast pass for cars while I get one for screaming California, she uses hers for cars, gets a stroller pass and I can use that to ride cars while we do the same for the roller coaster (could I have made that more confusing?)\n\n\n\n\nPart of the past question, does the stroller pass have to be used instantly or can it be used later in the day if the kiddo is having a melt down for instance?\n\n\n\n\nOn the Disney site where it shows the menu for Caf\u00e9 Orleans it doesn't show the Mint Julep on there, is it still sold there? We heard about it and need to try it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSorry this is \nso\n long, but any help would be greatly appreciated, we are kinda super planners and so like to figure these things out way in advance.

We had a war, but don't fret, there was only one casualty, a piece of paper he tore out of his autograph book that he threw at me. We ended up hanging out in the store with him for hours.

I've heard in front of small world is good for the parade, but I also want good fireworks seats with the ability to get in one last ride after.\n\n\nSecond, I have a national parks passport book, I use it to get stamps from national and state parks I visit, but I also like to use the journal pages in the back for other places I go. Last year I got unusable fast passes from all the rides and cut them up and taped them in, but do you think if I brought my own stamp pad, a CM at the gate would stamp my book with the exit stamp?\n\n\nDuring the 50th anniversary they hid 50 special mickeys throughout the park, my dad and I found all 50 in the 3 days we were there and it was a fun scavenger hunt to keep us busy in lines and during down times. Is there anything they are doing this year along those lines? I know there was that scavenger thing on the 60th, but is there something I'll be able to do next week?\n\n\nHow early do RSR fast passes run out? I know a year ago they were all gone by an hour after DCA opened, is it still that bad?\n\n\nDoes anyone have experience with the ART buses? The website only says they come every 15min, but I want to know how long my bus ride will be, so I know when to leave in the morning. Any idea where I can find this info?\n\n\nI'm so excited, 4 more days of work, then a day for last minute packing and then I'm in sunny California :)",

The first half of the \"Tour\" took us through the Boonta Eve Pod Racing sequence on Tatooine and then holo-Yoda came on to tell us to deliver the rebel spy safely. Then we jumped to light speed and arrived on Naboo right in the middle of the starfighters being attacked by vulture droids. Our starspeeder is shot down and starts to plummet into the ocean. \n\n\nRight as we hit the water, there is a loud boom and the screen goes into a flat line and then blank and all of the lights come on. The doors open and the park attendant comes in. He apologizes for the inconvenience and then starts looking around at the rows of people. He sees a girl in the second row on the last seat closest to the doors where you enter, and asks her if she is ok. Then proceeds to say \"I think you may want to get off...not feeling well?\" I turn and look back and the young girl is frantically tugging at her seatbelt to release it. The attendant helps her and she immediately jumps up to exit, and her father gets up and leaves with her as well.\n\n\nAt this point everyone is looking around at each other and whispering things like, \"I think that girl was going to puke...\" Then the mom confirms that she was in fact not feeling good and may have gestured in a way that made the attendant realize this as well. Either that or she was pulling on her seatbelt trying to get out. \n\n\nSo the attendant comes back in and tells us that we will be moving to another Starspeeder to finish our tour. So we all slowly go back in through the door where we entered and go down to the starspeeder on the opposite side. We all basically get our same seats and start the tour all over again. This time we land on Kashyyyk with the wookies and then holo-Ackbar and then back to Naboo to finish the sequence that was cut off on the first tour. Which coincidentally was requested by a mother and son, who stated they were never able to see it and were so close before the ride was interrupted. And the attendant said, \"Well, we'll just have to see where it takes us...\"\n\n\nTL;DR You are being watched very closely, the whole time on Star Tours!",

Listed subtitle devices were also not found. Simple accommodations like letting me take out my hearing aids before boarding water & drop\/spin rides, but after the last verbal safety instructions (or to be given the safety instructions written or otherwise prior) were not available. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is considered a non-DAS wheelchair disability?\n\n\n\n\nMy mother uses a cane or wheelchair due to prior strokes, fibromyalgia & other disabilities. She needs accommodations where we can safely\/swiftly exit the line with her limited mobility if she needs her medication, gets dizzy\/unsteady, etc.\n\n\nWithout a wheelchair, she can't stand in lines 20 min or longer, but as long as she doesn't have to climb more than a few steps, she can get on and off rides. So for rides like Rodger's Car Toon Spin, she could get up the step and into the taxi itself most likely, but she wouldn't be able to endure standing in the long line to get to the taxi without her chair. \n\n\nI worried about the DAS\/non-DAS wheelchair status & she's using her wheelchair in a narrow line (Tea Party, Snow White, It's A Small World, etc), we won't be able to get out easily if she needs to exit unexpectedly due to medical needs.\n\n\n\n\nThanks for any insight!",

Weather -\nWe're looking at booking the trip for late September \/ Early October - seems to be a good time for crowds based on what I have seen, but how is the Weather typically around that time of year?\n\n\n2).  Hotel -\nWe are looking at staying at either Disneyland Hotel, or the Hilton at Anaheim - is there any significant benefit for staying at the Park vs. off site?  It does seem a lot less expensive to stay at the Hilton - but are there particular things included in the price of DH that I may be missing?\n\n\n3).  Tickets -\nThis is probably the big one - how many days should I get a pass for? We'll be getting the Park Hopper pass as well, but I hear a lot of conflicting stories about how long we should out aside to see all of Disneyland - 3, 4 or 5 days would be best?\n\n\n4).  General Tips -\nOutside of that, just looking for any general tips you may have - must see rides; places to eat etc.\n\n\nThanks!",

  "text":"Hello r\/Disneyland! My mom is visiting me here in sunny Southern California and I'm treating her to 4 days at the Disneyland Resort. She hasn't been to the resort in 10 years so, as an annual passholder, I have a lot to fill her in on! \n\n\nOver the past 10 years my mom has gained a lot of weight due to some health issues but she is finally better and ready to go to the park for the 60th diamond celebration. I am fairly certain she will fit on all the rides but she is deathly afraid she is going to get up to the front of the line, try to sit in a seat and not fit and feel humiliated in front of everyone else waiting in line. She is about 5'7\" and around 260 lbs. \n\n\nHow can I help calm her fears? Is there any documentation on the Disney website about weight \/ fitting on rides? Any cast members here have any insight or experience handling a similar situation?",

That dead silent room with Roger getting electrocuted by the weasel is a stroke of genius that I don't think any other dark ride matches.",

  "title":"A magical Jungle Cruise proposal",
  "text":"Some photos to go with the story.\n\n\nI'll give you the tl;dr right now: I proposed to my girlfriend on the Jungle Cruise on Sunday, and it was a magical experience, thanks in large part to cast members.\n\n\nI could talk forever about how much Disneyland has meant to me and my now-fiance over the years, but my posts on this subreddit probably show it better. Most posts, especially ones about meals, include a mention of her, and it's because the parks are where we go to have fun, relax, and never grow old. There was never a question about me proposing there; it was just a question of when.\n\n\nAt the Disneyland 60th birthday subreddit meet-up, I finally met \/u\/mildly_interesting, and she was as great a hostess for our group as she is a mod for this sub. Shortly thereafter, my fiance picked a ring (she has to wear it, so why shouldn't she get some\/all the say?), so I began the process of whittling down where in the parks the proposal should take place. It was a short process -- Adventureland is our favorite place in the parks, and the Tiki Room, her favorite place, recently had that guerilla wedding. Among the criteria was that it had to be unique (there's plenty of documentation on YouTube), so the next best option was Jungle Cruise. She likes my corny sense of humor, so of course she likes the Jungle Cruise jokes. Anyway, what good fortune for me to have just made friends with a Jungle Cruise skipper.\n\n\n\/u\/mildly_interesting and I had the same idea: propose under Schweitzer Falls. So that was done, settled. She held the mic for me, and I proposed for the whole boat to hear while my cousin and her boyfriend were shooting photos and video. But I wanted to make the surprise even bigger, so I invited our friends and family to wait on the dock for us with Mickey balloons (which they don't start selling till 2 p.m., so they had to get help from a cast member to get them in the morning). The fiance was bowled over in the best of ways.\n\n\nIt all went perfectly, and the Jungle Cruise crew sent us away with several gifts on the house. I couldn't have asked for anything better, but then we got to our lunch at Carnation Cafe. I had made the reservation several days in advance, and I had to call to change the reservation when we got more people to come. I mentioned that this was part of a proposal, but because it was sort of last minute, they told me I'd have to talk to the manager day-of but before our reservation time to work out a plan. I didn't have time for that given the proposal plans, so I didn't expect them to do anything for us. But they did. They brought us an incredible dessert tray with bride\/groom ear hats (with our names on them, gotten from my mother when I wasn't looking) and Mr.\/Mrs. mugs, all for us to keep. I was floored. I had planned all the surprises so far, so I wasn't expecting to be surprised myself. It was the perfect way to cap off the whole proposal experience.\n\n\nWe treated the rest of the day like any other Disney day, riding all the rides and seeing all the things we wanted to. Not everyone with us gets to go often, so we wanted them to make the most of the time to enjoy it. In the end, it was a beautiful experience that we'll never forget, and it wouldn't have been nearly this magical (certainly no Disney magic in particular) without all the wonderful cast members who cared to make this moment and day practically perfect in every way.",

I asked her which Disney princess she loved and before she could answer, I told her that I loved Elsa. She told me she loved her too! She told me she loved Elsa more than I did.\n\n\nWe also discussed our favorite colors, told each other jokes, and talked about which rides we both loved the most. This girl was a girl of essence, \nshe had the magnanimity of love. We could have talked for hours without stopping and would still have fun without being awkward. She is the one...\n\n\nWho made my Disney stay fun and memorable. Her happiness was so shallow that everytime a Disney cast waves or smiles at her she would look at me and shout:\" They looked at me! \". But what definitely made her day were the Disney princesses noticing and acknowledging her presence by smiling and waving at her direction. She would smile and shout and inform me again that she was smiled\/waved at by \ninsert Disney princess here\n.\n\n\nAfter everything that we talked about, we had to part ways because the parade was over. She had to stay where she was because she was told by her mom to stay put after the parade. She waved me goodbye and saw the brightest smile I have ever seen. I just made this girl's day.\n\n\nPlot twist: Her grandma and her mom thanked me because I allowed the girl to sit in the front (better view of the parade) of the show. They were glad that their 6 year old girl and her baby brother had the best seats available with the bonus of having the most awesome \"babysitter\" around.\n\n\nPaint the Night parade was definitely fun because of that girl.

  "title":"A shoe enthusiasts guide to being comfortable throughout your vacation.",
  "text":"My wife stated that sore feet are a common ailment of longer trips to the parks and after just coming back from my first real trip to Disneyland\/California Adventure I figured you guys might like some recommendation from an enthusiast that currently owns 30+ pairs of shoes and has decent knowledge of the spread of comfortable shoes. Due to the fact that I am a sneaker fan and planned to be in the parks pretty much all day long for 5-6 days I only brought \"athletic\" shoes. I will go over shoes that either I recommend or know people generally consider when choosing shoes for Disneyland.\n\n\nShoes I brought to the parks.\n\n\nAdidas Ultra Boost\n\n\nPrice: $180\n\n\nUpper Material: Primeknit. A cloth knit\/mesh that allows for a lot of airflow and comfort. These uppers mold to your feet in a gentle way. An amazing shoe for dry conditions, the mesh would leave you with soggy feet if it were to rain.\n\n\nSole\/Midsole Tech: Boost. Adidas has grown tremendously this year due to poaching shoe designers, grabbing Kanye's line, and it's Boost technology. It is a ridiculously comfy sole tech that is available in a variety of pricepoints\/volumes and styles. The Ultra Boost model has the most boost in the sole of any models with allows for comfort from heel to toe and causes a bit of a springy step in my experience.\n\n\nComfort level: 10\/10 I wore these every time I knew we would be in the park for 4+ hours. For the 6 full days we were there, my feet didn't hurt once.\n\n\nReview: I figured these would be the comfiest pair I brought but the truly blew everything else out of the water. These were my default \"long-walk\" shoes prior to the trip and so I've had plenty of time for wear tests. Unlike the more traditional soles of my other shoes I feel little-to-no pressure on my heels from standing in lines with my Ultra Boosts. Although the cost of these may turn many people away, they truly are the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn in my entire life and sources such as Ebay and the Adidas Employee Store in Portland, OR can help one find a brand new pair for well-under retail.\n\n\nNike Flyknit Lunar 2\n\n\nPrice: $80-130 (Last year's model so prices will vary heavily.)\n\n\nUpper Material: Flyknit. Nike's mesh\/knit material. Also breathable and cool but not good for wet weather.\n\n\nSole\/Midsole: Lunarlon. Lunarlon is a much more cushioned material than what you would find on a traditional sneaker midsole such as rubber or EVA. It is a very comfortable walking\/running shoe midsole and I find that to be ideal for keeping your feet from aching. \n\n\nComfort level: 8.5\/10\n\n\nReview: Prior to Boost, the sneaker community generally regarded lunarlon, especially combined with flyknit uppers, to be the most comfortable running shoe(And by that we generally mean as an everyday-use shoe, not a competitive running shoe). Lunarlon is a bit stiffer than boost in my opinion and it simply is just lacking that extra that makes Boost so popular. Lunarlon has been around for a while so for those that are more budget-concerned, you should be able to find flyknit lunars and lunarlon soled shoes for $50-100 on ebay.\n\n\nAir Max Lunar 1\n\n\nPrice $60-130\n\n\nUpper Material: Synthetic Leather. A material most people are used to. Not stiff like cheap dress shoes but nothing comfy like a knit material. I wanted a leather or synthetic leather pair to bring in case of rain. We experienced a pretty decent downpour spanning 15-20 minutes and my feet were dry.\n\n\nSole\/Midsole Tech: Lunarlon. It's not quite the same as the flyknit lunar setup so I did notice some of that heel pressure when waiting in line for extended periods of time.\n\n\nComfort Level: 7.5\/10 \n\n\nReview: As the weather didn't rain much these low-top leather shoes were completely fine for brief stints of rain. For fall or winter weather I would probably bring more of these types of shoes unless the parks were supposed to get super drenched in which case I would explore boot options.\n\n\nNike Flyknit Racer\n\n\nPrice: $150\n\n\nUpper Material: Newer Flyknit as seen in flyknit lunar 2.\n\n\nSole: The sole is a pretty basic rubber sole. I noticed a bit of that heel pressure but I was surprised how comfortable they were for the unspecified midsole type.\n\n\nComfort: 7.5\/10\n\n\nReview: These were a recent purchase that I thought looked really cool so I brought them for fashion purposes lol. They held up quite well and if I were to come back in summer I'd probably just bring them and the ultra boosts.\n\n\nShoes I have experience walking in\n\n\nVans low top- Very basic, thin soles lead to a lot of mid and forefoot pain in my experience.\n\n\nNike free-Thin sole designed for a barefoot feel. Good for keeping balance and for running on more forgiving conditions but doesn't provide enough cushion IMO.\n\n\nBonus note\/Recommendation\n\n\nAlthough my wife was the one to tell me to bring comfy shoes, she ended up trying to survive on Teva sandals, croc sandals(NOT the clog abominations) and other supposedly comfortable\/durable sandals. By the end of day 2 she broke down and asked if we could get some comfy sneakers. We were able to find the more affordable option to the aforementioned Ultra Boosts in the line of \nPure Boost 2\n these come in a variety of types such as the \"Chill\" model which allows for a more breathable upper. They are currently in their 2nd generation so new in box models of the Pure Boost and Pure Boost 2 could be found for $50-$120 mark. Although there is less Boost density than the ultra boost, the Pure Boost has been widely regarded as more comfortable than the ultra boost for casual use. Not only did this prevent my wife from experiencing worse foot pain, her feet actually felt better every day, which I'm sure was a combination of doing a bit less walking as well as having a more cushioned sole.\n\n\nI know that this is only a fraction of the available models on the market and that not everyone is OK with dropping $100+ on shoes but I figured as someone that has a lot of experience with shoes, specifically those selected for use in Disneyland, some might find this little guide useful. If you have any other shoe-related questions I'll be more than happy to answer them!",

  "text":"I'm such a crazy planner and I don't go to the parks nearly as much as I want to! I'm from SF but my bf's from LA so we go pretty often but just not often enough! Because we only go for one day at a time about 2-4 times a year, we go from rope drop to close.\n\n\nHere's a sample one day\/two park agenda for me:\n\n\n\n\n7am (assuming the park opens at 8) have an irish coffee, use the bathroom, wait to get into the promenade, get into DCA and wait for rope drop\n\n\n\n\n8am DCA rope drop, immediately get my Radiator Racer Springs fastpass, go ride Screaming CA, Toy Story Midway Mania, and then maybe even Screaming CA again (at rope drop the lines are seriously only like 10-15 minutes long max! It's a great time to knock out some big rides)\n\n\n\n\n9am get a small snack for breakfast, sit in the big room that plays Disney movie highlights and concept art (where Turtle Talk, Animation Academy, or the Frozen Meet\/Greet is).\n\n\n\n\n9.30am I'll go to Tower of Terror or Soaring Over CA, whichever is shorter.\n\n\n\n\n10am (2 hours after you got your radiator racers springs fast pass) you can grab a second fast pass, either Tower of Terror or Soaring, whichever you didn't ride. Also, your Radiator Racers Springs fast pass might be approaching within the hour, DO NOT MISS IT!\n\n\n\n\nFrom then until Noon (when DCA starts serving alcohol) it's a free time, I grab a World of Color fastpass (it doesn't count towards your ride fast passes), I might go through the Wilderness Explorer Camp, go on Grizzly River Run, use our fast passes or just walk through\/ take pictures in Cars Land. \n\n\n\n\nNOON! This is crucial for my boyfriend to be happy, we'll go to a sit down restaurant. I love the World of Color price fixed lunch, we take a few hours to have cocktails and sit and eat and talk. Or the Cove Bar is another great spot. This is our mini break to relax and have some adult beverages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith me so far? After lunch we're going over to Disneyland!\n \n\n\n\n\n2pm head over to Disneyland, go to tomorrow land and grab a Space Mountain Fastpass. Then go onto Startours or Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters (whichever is shorter).\n\n\n3pm switch back to Adventureland, take pictures by the castle on the way, visit Snow White's wishing well. Tiki Room\/Dolewhip.\n\n\n4pm Ride one\/fast pass another: Jungle Cruise\/ Indy.\n\n\n5pm Try to squeeze in a ride on Haunted Mansion and Pirates or Splash if I have time before my Space Mountain fast pass.\n\n\n6pm Probably about time for Space Mountain (if it's before 8pm I'll wait), ride and then get out for dinner at DCA.\n\n\n\n\nI know you're tired but you're over half way there! Only 6 more hours to get all of the Disney Fun!\n\n\n\n\n7pm dinner\/drinks most likely at Flo's. Or maybe at Award Weiners with drinks from Mad Tea Party.\n\n\n8pm More drinks at Mad Tea Party? Second ride on Tower of Terror? Maybe a last minute ride on Screaming if you can squeeze it in.\n\n\n9pm World of Color.\n\n\n\n\nALMOST THERE! ONLY 2 MORE HOURS OR SO, YOU'RE KILLING IT\n\n\n\n\nThis last section is for all the Disney, Pirates is almost always a 10-15 minute wait this late at night. Splash Mountain is always a 5 minute wait. I'll do one bigger ride (Indy, Thunder Railroad, Matterhorn).\n\n\nIt should be like 11.30, one last space mountain ride.\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATS, YOU'VE DONE WHAT MANY HAVE SAID IS IMPOSSIBLE! NOW GO HOME, cause your legs probably feel like jello.\n\n\nDo you guys have agendas\/rules for a long packed day at the park? I love me some agendas :]",

The calendar function seems almost entirely inaccurate. \n\n\nI've gone on two different \"Ghost Town\" calendar days only to find massive crowds as soon as I got into the park that stayed massive all day. Dapper Day was a scheduled \"Yup It's Packed\" and wound up being a pretty clear cut code red \"Forget About It\". \n\n\nBut it gets things wrong in the other direction too! Yesterday I went in for what was scheduled to be a \"Hey It's Alright\" and it was almost definitely a \"Ghost Town\", Space Mountain barely exceeded a 30 minute line all day for example, the walkways were mostly empty, and I walked straight on to almost every ride I went on. Meanwhile out of curiosity I just checked the line times for today, a \"Ghost Town\" day, and the park looks like it's poppin! 40-55 minutes every which way. \n\n\nSo I guess I'm just writing this firstly to warn people to not treat it as gospel and secondly to inquire if there are some kind of mitigating circumstances that are making times inaccurate or some intricacy to the site I'm not understanding?

  "text":"Here's the scenario:\nYou are given the opportunity to add an expansion\/minor addition to the resort. It can be anything, but it can't already be happening (Star Wars Land is a good example of this) but in order for it to happen, you've got to move one ride from one park to the opposite park (doesn't make sense, but adds a bit of discussion to the topic) and switch it for another ride in the park you're moving it to. For instance, I want to add a new hotel where the bus lots are and move the bus lots over to the lot Disney purchased across the street. Guests will enter the resort by crossing a sky walk over Harbor Blvd. and into the hotel, where CM's will greet every family as they arrive. (I'm pretty sure this was considered\/is still in consideration - I support it) In order to \"make room\" I'll move Ariel's Undersea Adventure into Disneyland and switch it for Gadget's Go Coaster, which would be rethemed for Paradise Pier.",

I plan on checking off every hidden Mickey I can. I know I'm not the first to do this. Is there a running checklist we can add to? If not, mods can we get something started? I'm talking everything from tying beignets in New Orleans square, riding the tender seat, the pet cemetery, the wheelhouse, and last but not least, a buffet experience in club 33. And that's just rattling me off from the head. The park is full of endless wonders and quantifying them could possibly detract from that magic so I don't want to do it if it doesn't sound great.

  "title":"Story of an amazing cast member and the highlight of our trip",
  "text":"Home now (sigh) and finally have time to write this all out.  Meant to do it for storytime Friday but we were just so busy!\n\n\nSo I posted on Tuesday that the Jedi Training Academy isn't doing sign-ups anymore.  It's something that we had wanted to do for years, but having two kids with Autism Spectrum Disorder, we didn't think it was a good idea.  Both my boys have emotional regulation problems - one with little control, one with way too much control.  So if the younger one didn't get picked from the crowd, we would have a day-ending tantrum on our hands; and the other would probably never get picked as he just isn't capable of displaying the excitement necessary to catch the Jedi Master's eye.  So we had gone out of our way to avoid the area during shows for our past three trips, and never told the kids that it existed.\n\n\nThis time, thinking that there were sign-ups, we had a plan! My mom went at 7 am to find the sign-up spot and stand in line while my husband and I got the kids ready to go.  And my mom wandered around and around trying to find it.  We got there about 7:45 and I started asking CMs.  One wasn't sure, one had no idea what we were talking about, and the third - Diane - knew exactly what we were looking for but told us, unfortunately, it had been a trial, and they decided not to continue doing it.\n\n\nI was super disappointed, obviously, as now my kids knew it existed and were excited to see the show.  I said \"Oh no\" and told her we were so excited to be able to sign up as I had two kids with ASD and the getting-picked-from-the-crowd method would be too difficult for them.\n\n\nShe could have said, \"I'm really sorry about that\" and gone back to her job.  But she didn't.  She said, \"Let me see what I can do...\"\n\n\nShe took my kids' names, said she'd speak to a cast member and to meet her back here at 10:15 (just before the show) to see.\n\n\nWe went and rode some rides, had some snacks, and tried to downplay the Jedi show, as we really didn't know what would happen.\n\n\nWe came back at 10:15 and Diane came out with another cast member (supervisor maybe?) who said they couldn't guarantee spots and to just get the kids to be as excited as possible.  But they also looked at what the kids were wearing.\n\n\nWe took the kids back to the seating area and tried to temper expectations as best we could, and tried to coach the older child in \"how to act excited.\" \n\n\nShowtime comes, the Jedi arrive, every kid there has it turned to 11, except my eldest.  My younger son gets picked pretty quickly. My eldest is still hanging back and meekly waving.  Kid after kid gets picked. The girl right beside him gets picked.  That one was heartbreaking. (\"You there, in the grey...\" gasp! maybe! \"... Star Wars shirt!\" DANG! He had an Avengers shirt.)  My mom and I are watching and we're trying to figure out how many robes are left. We guide the older child to the front (as all the kids in front of us were picked) and tell him to wave both arms as big as he can.  \n\n\nHe was the LAST KID picked.  I'm still amazed that out of that crowd of kids (many of whom have turned it up well past 11 at this point), my kiddo got in.  And I can only think that Diane did manage to do something for us.  Does the Jedi Master have an earpiece and crowd spotters?  I don't know.  \n\n\nBut I do know that my kids had an amazing time.  The younger boy, wearing a Darth Vader shirt, was offered a fistbump by the stormtrooper.  He shook his head and made the \"I've got my eyes on you\" gesture.  He was so incredibly into the lightsaber fight with Darth Vader! And the eldest even cracked a smile when he was given his lightsaber! This is amazing for him.  And he won't stop talking about it, which is how we know he really loved it.\n\n\nSo Diane, from Pico Rivera, CA, who works at Tomorrowland Terrace - if you ever see this - thank you, from the bottom of my heart.  You put the magic in our trip in a way I will never forget.  I put in a guest compliment for you but I was totally sobbing in City Hall (and I may be again now, typing this out).  I had your name, hometown and area written down on my phone and showed the CM at City Hall so I hope it does eventually get to you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",

On Indiana Jones, the Cast Member at the start of the line checked the return time on my pass, a Cast Member in the blue costume scanned it about 4 yards into the queue, and a third Cast Member collected the pass as I entered the temple.\n\n\nOn RSR, I watched from the Single Rider queue as the Cast Member at the merge location collected passes and handed them off to another CM in blue for scanning.\n\n\nI didn't see anyone scanning on Haunted Mansion, but this could be due in part to theft that this attraction doesn't usually have FastPass outside of the holiday overlay so they don't need statistics in quite the same way.\n\n\nCertainly caught my interest though.

The buffet offerings were unique, but lukewarm and not that tasty.  The hotel lounge and restaurant seemed horribly understaffed- we got our drinks during dessert.  PCH Grille was saved by the dessert buffet though- make your own smores were amazing.\n\n\nCalifornia Adventure on Thursday.  It was fun comparing and contrasting the differences in the rides (we have been to Disney World several times).  Cars was so much better themed than Test Track.  We ate at Carthay Circle and thanks to Reddit we had the fried cheese biscuits and the Firecracker Wings.  My husband now loves those wings more than me.  Lunch proper was...okay, but the drinks were fantastic- especially the Poison Appletinis.  \n\n\nWe had corndogs for dinner, and when they say \"hot\", they mean it.  World of Color show was fun and very pretty.\n\n\nLast day at Disneyland.  Pirates is sooo much better here!  Longer ride!  Met up with some cousins so it was nice having a guide.

Gingerbread smell FTW!\n\n\nDinner was at Blue Bayou, and while good, I agree with others that you are paying for the ambiance.  \n\n\nWe finished off with the Halloween party.  The parade and fireworks were incredible.  We did some trick or treating, which was fun.  Saw LOTS of Elsas, but also a fair amount of Princess Leias, which took me back to my childhood.\n\n\nHands down BEST costume of the trip was seeing a baby Mike Wazowski taking a picture with Sully.  They should use that shot in marketing.\n\n\nWe had a great time on our trip.  Can't wait to go to Disney World again in March now!\n\n\nedit:  Can't believe I forgot!  We got trapped on Pirates (and yes, made the joke \"when the Pirates of the Caribbean ride breaks down, the pirates don't eat the people).  Ended up being taken off the ride and getting two fast passes!",

  "text":"Just like the title says...with Disney's signature attention to detail, what would you most like to explore if you had all the time you wanted? To keep it fun and varying, we'll say you can pick one from each park.\n\n\nDisneyland-The Haunted Mansion.\nAn attraction I was TERRIFIED of as a child, it's now my favorite Disney attraction out of anything, and something I'm pretty obsessed with. Every time I ride it, I lament the fact that I can't take my time in the portrait hallway after the stretching room. The portraits themselves are incredible, and the lightning\/rain effect is ridiculously realistic. Plus, it goes without saying I'd have to sit at the table in the grand hall.\n\n\nCalifornia Adventure-I'd be tempted to say Tower of Terror, but there's not much \"show\" area to explore outside of the lobby. I think, then, I would say RSR. I'd love to walk the track and see those amazing animatronics up close and personal.",

  "title":"Disneyland Binder suggestions",
  "text":"For my first trip to DL in 2007 my amazing dad created a disney binder, with information about both parks and downtown disney. Everyone made fun of him for it, in a loving manner of course, but I on the other hand loved it and even blame him for my disney obsession sometimes. We live 4 hours away and with all of us are moved out of the house and one out of state, we are finally planning a trip December 3-5 this year. It will be my dad, his girlfriend, my 2 sisters (ages 27 and 24) and I (age 21)  plus all of our SO, so 8 in total. I have already been 4 times just this year, but I haven't been with my family in over 3 years now. While cleaning out the garage I found the old beloved disneyland binder from 2007, and as a surprise I want to revamp it for him. The original binder had sections for Disneyland, CA Adventures, Downtown Disney, Dining, and Event Calendar. Mostly just things he printed directly from the website about rides or location. I am going to keep the original sections, for a nostalgic tone. But would like to add some new things in as well considering as you all know ALOT of things have changed since 2007. My ideas include new sections for fun facts and Season of the force (Star Wars is an obsession me and my dad share!) but I was hoping that the people of this beautiful subreddit that I have been lurking on for about a year could help me with any other creative ideas or special things I could put in the binder as well!",

This happened at River Belle, Wiener Works, Plaza Inn, Golden Horseshoe, Julius Katz & Sons, and World of Disney.\n\n\nEvery time, the cast member would ask me if I had one of the \"new passes.\" At River Belle, we were the very last customers for breakfast, so the guy waited it out and at least two minutes later (maybe 3), the system would finally approve the discount. Every other time, it caused a pretty bad disruption in the line to the point where guests would start to get miffed, and the cast member would cancel the transaction, ask me which level of pass I had, take my word for it, and manually apply the discount.\n\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else is having this problem with the Signature passes. The reason I'm curious is I am one of the people who went out and bought one of the remaining Premium Annual Passport vouchers from a Disney Store the day after the prices went up. It took a very long time (I would say 15 minutes) for them to redeem my voucher and issue my pass at the ticket booth.

Heres the catch, the idea i have is pretty awesome but idk if disney will help me do it, which is why i need some opinions. My idea is that when we go itll be around christmas time so they will have all the stuff out and the parade (her favorite time of the year there) and we always go to watch the parade. I was thinking that right before it starts, i can lie and say im going to the bathroom or something like that. And while she thinks im going to the bathroom im really going to be setting myself up on the parade. so when the show starts and when my section of the parade comes by her i was going to invite her onto the parade float and do a whole speech of how much i love her and all the cheesy goodness that i know she will love, and then thats when i pop the question (mind you infront of everyone). my true question is, I know they wont just let me on a parade float, so who do i talk to to see if they can help me do all this? will they even help me do all this? this will be the only time i see her (cuz im in the Navy) and i want it to be the most special moment in her entire life, something that she will never forget.

  "title":"{FAQ Redo} When to Go",
  "text":"Welcome to Sunday FAQ Redo, a new weekly discussion post to help improve the Wiki. \nWe're currently in the process of rewriting\n, and we could use your help! If there's anything you'd like to add, please let us know!\n\n\nThis week's topic: When to Go\n\n\n\n\n\u00bao\u00ba\n Will it be crowded?\n\n\nAre your kids out of school? Are you on Spring Break? Well, so is everyone else. Disneyland is very rarely slow. There are very few days where it\u2019s empty, but the best days are In late August and mid January. Keep in mild that during these down periods, many attractions will be closed due to refurbishments. Avoid New Years Eve, New Years, Valentines Day, the 4th of July, July 17th (Disneyland\u2019s birthday), Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and Christmas. Visit this \nCrowd Predictor\n to see what your trip will be like \n\n\nMornings are usually less busy than afternoons. The popular iPhone app \nMouse Wait\n shows a live crowd index rating. This is also available to view on the \nMouse Wait website\n. Tuesdays are the slowest days of the week.\n\n\n\u00bao\u00ba\n Ride closures\n\n\nWater Attractions such as Splash Mountain and Grizzly River Run are closed around Winter\/Spring time. The weeks following up to major holiday celebrations is also the time when attractions get their holiday overlays. For example, in September you may find Haunted Mansion and Space Mountain closed. In November, you may find Jungle Cruise and It\u2019s a Small World closed.\n\n\nVisit this website\n to see what attractions will be closed. Keep in mind that attractions may be unpredictably closed on your trip.\n\n\nWith the construction of the Star Wars themed land, many attractions will be closing in January 2016. There is no word on when these attractions will open.\n\n\n\u00bao\u00ba\n California Weather\n\n\nSouthern California is known for it\u2019s sunny skies, but be warned that it does rain every once in a while. Always check the weather before your trips. Disneyland does not own a dome to keep the rain away. There are ponchos available for purchase.\n\n\nOur \u201cwinter\u201d consists of cold mornings, mild days, and freezing nights (see SoCal\u2019s definition of cold: 70 degrees). If you come any time between late September-February, bring a light jacket if you plan on staying late past 6.\n\n\nSummer, however, can be killer. We've historically been hit will 105 degree weather in July.\n\n\nRain\n\n\nBring ponchos, umbrellas, waterproof housing for phones\/cameras, Water Resistant shoes (puddles form EVERYWHERE), and a small hand towel or two.\n\n\nIndoor attractions are a great place to hide from the rain. This includes the Enchanted Tiki Room, Aladdin at the Hyperion, Animation Academy, Great Moments with Lincoln, Main Street Cinema, Star Wars Launch Bay\/Superhero HQ, and Disney Junior \u2013 Live on Stage!. You may also hang out in the hotel lobbies.\n\n\nThe Plaza Inn and The Village Haus Restaurant have some warm foods in an enclosed dining area. The Golden Horseshoe is also enclosed and has the Laughing Stock Company. You can find coffee inside the Jolly Holiday Bakery and Cafe, Market House (Starbucks), and Fiddler, Fifer, and Practical (Starbucks).\n\n\nList of Attractions closed due to rain\n. Keep in mind that this may change and more\/less will close. If there is thunder, most attractions will close.\n\n\nHot\n\n\nStay hydrated! This includes children! Don't push yourself or your family on hot days.\n\n\nGrab fastpasses for Splash Mountain and Grizzly River Run early. Hide away in the Enchanted Tiki Room (grab dole whip!), Aladdin at the Hyperion, Animation Academy, Great Moments with Lincoln, Main Street Cinema, Star Wars Launch Bay\/Superhero HQ, and Disney Junior \u2013 Live on Stage!. You may also hang out in the hotel lobbies.\n\n\nFor kids, visit Bugs Land in DCA, where you'll find a water fountain that you can play in.\n\n\nThe Plaza Inn, The Village Haus Restaurant, and The Golden Horseshoe have an enclosed dining area. The Golden Horseshoe also has the Laughing Stock Company show. You can find slushies at the Candy Palace on Main Street.",

I had created a series of clues that would lead from attraction to attraction so when my girlfriend went to the washroom I left the first clue with my daughter and ran off.  Every cast member at the rides entrance got right into it when I asked for their help with this and she was able to find each clue until she crossed the moat and made her way to the wishing well. I was there waiting with her Disneyland favorite...a bouquet of Churros!!!!  Looking over the Snow White pond I got down on one knee and asked her to marry me!!  Thank goodness she said yes!!!  While I was waiting the evil queen came by and asked about my churro bouquet and when I told her what I was waiting for she had a wonderful interaction with her evilness!  Can't say enough good about the cast members, including our waiter at the river belle terrace for fantastic dining package!  Then ended our perfect day with an incredible fantasmic show and a chance discovery of the soft opening for Hyperspace Mountain!!!  Like it was just for us!!!!  \n\n\nSorry for being long winded but I just had to share!!  If anyone is interested I could post the video of her search to find me after I get it edited.",

  "title":"Stupid parking mini rant",
  "text":"My mom and I decided to come up to the park for a couple of hours. And if we had known that it'd cost us more gas and time just parking, honestly we wouldn't have bothered. \nFor the last few years, Anaheim Police will shut down Mickey and Friends at random times for random periods because, well, I guess they don't have anything better to do. The lots are never full, there aren't any security threats, and if you ask a cast member about it they'll either feign ignorance or say \"oh yeah, they do that.\" \nSo now we're in Toy Story--the shittiest of shitty lots. And our carefree trip for a few hours has now been cut down and we're both annoyed. \nIf they could give us a semblance of a reason why they close the ramp other than they want to try to fill their shittiest lot, I'd be less annoyed. Till then, I suggest that every time a passholder--who pays a lot and probably spends more than the once-and-a-while parkgoers--can't park in Mickey and Friends for no apparent reason, Disney should take $5 off our passes. \nEnd stupid rant. \n\n\nEdit: on the other hand we had the best City Hall cast members! It made me feel 1000000% better that they not only understood my annoyance (let me add that I was really polite. The reason for the rant here was to blow off some steam) but they've also been the victims of shitty parking--which makes me madder actually! I'm here for fun--they have to make it to work on time!",

I ended up getting a job at Disney which is a dream of mine since I have a bachelor's degree in Animation, any job at Disney is crazy to me.

Not only that, when we arrived at the castle (tears had been falling out of my 23yo face all day) he told me to get out my phone and he made our entire tour group wait as he took my first photo in front of the castle..... Ryan went above and beyond, even for a traditions class, he made it his mission to make my entire day magical and I feel so completely blessed to be apart of this family..... if anyone knows the Ryan I am referring to, give him the biggest thank you for making my first day at work so flippin awesome!!!!",

Now, whenever we go, we always find ourselves directed away from there and it takes us an extra 20 minutes to fight the traffic with everyone else to be herded to another parking location. (Usually Pumbaa or Toy Story).\n\n\nThe annoying part is half the time we are routed away from it, I see that there are several empty levels in the parking structure. We have now begun to head directly for Toy Story's parking lot, and honestly, it usually works out to be faster and easier. But I still miss riding the trams into the park. I rode the tram in to the park as a kid and I sort of miss that experience when you first show up to the park. That and the wife has a bladder the size of an acorn and it's nice to have a bathroom at the parking structure.\n\n\nWe've come up with theories, but we don't know how accurate they are. I think the one we believe the most is the parking structure doesn't fill up until late, when routing that many cars through the streets of Anaheim would cause gridlock. If we are routed away from M&F at 1:00 in the afternoon, it's not a big deal, but if they did that at 4:00, there would be trouble. But still, we like to park there and on Fridays we usually try to stay at Trader Sams until late, and it's just so much easier to cut across the parking lots to the structure than walk all of Downtown Disney to catch the bus on the other side of the Esplande. \n\n\nAnyone have better insight to how and when the structure is being used?",

I'm a 22 year old who wanted to travel after college, so I decided to leave in September and embark on a 10 month travel from Thailand, Australia, and New Zealand, working in Aus and NZ. It's only been about 3 months now and this has been the longest I've ever been away from home, but I'm loving every moment of it good or bad and have been learning so much. Through all of this I've been constantly listening and watching anything that's Disney,  going to my happy place. My all time favorite song I love to listen to when baking or in the kitchen is \nhttp:\/\/www.everythingdisneyland.com\/music-and-rides\/critter-country-disneyland-music\/video\/splash-mountain-area-music\n. It just erases all of my worries and brings me back to all the magical memories. I know this isn't your typical post found on this sub but I just wanted to let you know how important Disney can be to some people and how it holds a precious part in each of our lives wherever we may be, or doing each day. I want to thank everyone who makes it special and creating that Disney magic. I had never considered myself a Disney fanatic  (I don't think I am) but every time I see one of your guys post on here it always brings a smile to my face. Anyhoo, just wanted to throw that out there and let you guys know how awesome this sub is and all the amazing memories we've all bestowed. Thanks",

Won't somebody think of the children?\n\n\n\n\nI took a good long look at Tom Sawyer Island. Since they converted the fort to F! backstage, there really is nothing for me as a visitor in the top third of the island.  The Settler's grave yard is about it.\n\n\nIf they cut the island a bit, you KNOW there has to be some kind of TLC budget for the rest of the island.  Maybe they'll even get rid of the pirate theming and turn it back into Tom Sawyer's Island. Wont Somebody think of the Children?!?\n\n\nThe rumors are that they will be building a fairly substantial berm between the train and star wars land (can't have a train in space, what is this, Treasure Planet?) and that they are going to be putting water falls like cascade peak in there. Right now there's a bunch of non animatronic animals and that's about it. They really can't afford the north end to not be an upgrade PR wise here.\nSo sound off. do you think that it's as the gaffer says, \"Alls well that ends better\" or am I sipping too much cough medicine?",

  "title":"{FAQ Redo} Disneyland Alone",
  "text":"Welcome to Sunday FAQ Redo, a new weekly discussion post to help improve the Wiki. \nWe're currently in the process of rewriting\n, and we could use your help! If there's anything you'd like to add, please let us know!\n\n\nThis week's topic: Disneyland Alone\n\n\n****Congratulations gathering the courage to go to Disneyland alone! Going solo as a great experience. The best thing to do is to take a deep breath, relax and soak up the magic. In the words of Peter Pan, \"You get to have all the fun and don't have to share!\"\n\n\nFirst off, when you get in the park, make sure to ask for an \"I'm Celebrating!\" button from a cast member. If anyone asks what you're celebrating, say \"Freedom!\" or \"Me Party!\" or make something up. It's always fun to visit while wearing a button.\n\n\nPictures:\n \n\n\n\n\nSelfie sticks are \nnot\n permitted in the parks. However, any cast member will gladly take photos for you with your own, even photopass cast members.\n\n\n\n\nMeeting people:\nDon't be afraid to talk to the people in line with you, it feels a little awkward at first, but great friends can be made! You obviously already have two things in common: you like Disneyland, and you like whatever you're in line for! Try asking people where they're from. It's always an easy icebreaker. \n\n\nHave a drink and meet new people! You can post on \/r\/Disneyland and ask who's at the park and wants to meet up, or you can grab a drink and casually chat with other guests. Great places for socializing with friends you haven't met yet:    \n\n\n\n\nCove Bar (DCA)\n\n\nCarthay Circle Lounge (DCA)\n\n\nTrader Sam's (Disneyland Hotel)\n\n\nHearthstone Lounge (Grand Californian)\n\n\n\n\nStrike up a conversation with a cast member, they know a lot of park history, tips, and where the best Hidden Mickeys are.\n\n\nSingle Rider Line:\nWhat is it? When a ride has a group car, a cast member might need one or two people to fill it up. Single riders get the chance to skip the standby line and jump ahead to the front. This can cut down your wait time to 3-5 minutes. Not all rides have a Single Rider Line, and not all of them are open all day. Here's a list of rides that accommodate single riders:\n\n\n\n\nIndiana Jones Adventure (DL) \u2013 \nNot always offered\n\n\n\n\nSplash Mountain (DL)\n\n\n\n\nMatterhorn Bobsleds (DL)\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Screamin\u2019 (DCA)\n\n\n\n\nGoofy\u2019s Sky School (DCA)\n\n\n\n\nGrizzly River Run (DCA)\n\n\n\n\nRadiator Springs Racers (DCA)\n\n\n\n\nSoarin\u2019 Over California (DCA) - \nUses the FASTPASS Entrance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere To Decompress\nBeing alone is great when you'd like to take it easy and people watch. Go ahead and grab a Dole Whip and head to these places for a pleasent people watch:\n\n\n\n\nPatios on Main Street. There are a couple shops on Main Street that have some chairs on them. Perfect to watch kids awe over all of the Disney sights.\n\n\nSnow White's Wishing Well. While there's no seating, it can get pretty quiet here. Be sure to listen to the well!\n\n\nHarbor Galley, across the street from The Haunted Mansion has a small eating area behind it. To get to it, walk past the main eating area on the right and follow the path. You'll find the secondary tables, but continue on and you'll reach a bridge that crosses over Splash Mountain's drop off. You catch a group coming down the fall and spot them three times in various places in that area.\n\n\nMark Twain Riverboat waiting area. Great place to see the Disney Ducks! (Bonus: ask a CM if you can steer the Mark Twain!)\n\n\nAladdin's Oasis (DL)\n\n\nWOC Viewing Area during the late afternoon\/early evening:  You can watch the technicians start to prepare for WOC starting around 04:30p, you also get an amazing view of Paradise Pier\n\n\nThe Hub:  This references the center part of Disneyland that is right in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle where the \"Partners\" statue is.  Grab a seat and watch everyone dash off to the attractions in the various lands\n\n\nThe Coca-Cola Refreshment Corner:  This is located on the left hand side at the end of Main Street when you are walking towards the Castle.  Pull up a chair, listen to some Ragtime piano and do some more people watching.\n\n\n\n\nAttractions:\n \n\n\n\n\nRide the train. You can sit alone, feel the breeze, and listen to Bill Rogers talk about Disneyland.\n\n\nThe Disneyland Story presenting Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln",

  "text":"Welcome to Sunday FAQ Redo, a new weekly discussion post to help improve the Wiki. \nWe're currently in the process of rewriting\n, and we could use your help! If there's anything you'd like to add, please let us know!\n\n\nThis week's topic: Disneyland with Adults\/Teens\n\n\n\n\n>Tips for going with just a group of Adults:\n\n\nWarning: please be mindful of other guests. There are places to do \"adult\" things. However, Disneyland is a kid-first park, so they will not hesitate to throw you out for being too rowdy.\n\n\nThe first thing you need to know about \nfight club\n drinking in Disneyland, is that you can't. Club 33 \nexists\n, but you need a lot of money, a lot of patience, or you need to know somebody. This is and always will be the plan because they want to keep the Disneyland image \"clean\".\n\n\nCalifornia Adventure is a different story. DCA offers a selection of craft beers and other alcoholic beverages in multiple areas of the park. The best place for beer is at the Pacific Wharf, more specifically the Karl Strauss Wagon. They offer a variety of microbrews. Rita's Margaritas is also located here, and offers Strawberry and Lime margaritas. There is also the little known Sonoma Terrace inside of the Pacific Wharf. Often unseen by guests, they serve handpicked and local craft brews, as well as some wine. Not many people know about it, so there is no wait and is very quiet. At night, they open up the Drink Me bar at the Mad T Party, located at the Hollywood Studios Backlot. \n\n\nIf you want to spend a bit more money, there are a few \"high class\" options as well. Opposite of the \"food side\" of the Pacific Wharf, is the Alfresco Tasting Terrace, Mendocino Terrace, Wine Country Trattoria, and the previously mentioned Sonoma Terrace. They offer a huge selection of wine and snacks. However, this is not really a place to \"be rowdy\". It is \nvery\n expensive and is \nvery\n high class. There is also the Carthay Circle Lounge bar. You can order almost any cocktail, and they also serve craft beer. Finally, there is the Cove Bar. Hiding in plain sight behind Ariel's Grotto in Paradise Pier, this bar specializes in huge mixed drinks. They have a nice selection of mixers, as well as a secret menu. This place does serve food, including the infamous Lobster Nachos.\n\n\nFinally, there is the recently opened Trader Sam's, located next to the Disneyland hotel. They specialize in mixed drinks and offer amazing food, but the theming of the restaurant is incredible, inspired by the headhunter Trader Sam in the Jungle Cruise. It could be it's own attraction inside the park. There is a patio on the outside, that offers the full menu and has a live Hawaiian music band. On the inside, there is a completely interactive bar. You experience things like an active volcano, the bartender shrinking your seat, and animatronic Tiki heads.",

  "title":"Alternatives to Disneyland. :(",
  "text":"Sadly, my family will not be renewing our passes this year due to a recent addition to our family, the price hike of the premium passes and so many planned refurbishments while Star Wars Land is built. We plan to return when Marvel and Star Wars are in full effect but since we've been to the park average about 3-4 times a month for the past 2 years we've decided a year or 2 of a break will only make us love it more. That and our newborn will be old enough to enjoy it as much as our 5 year old did when we first started at age 3.\n\n\nSo here is my question to you, I know there is no real alternative to going to Disneyland. All the magic that happens there is not something the majority of entertainment establishments put forth when creating amusement parks family fun centers but all things considered, when you guys want to have family fun but do not go to Disneyland, what do you find yourselves doing?\n\n\nI looked at passes for Knott's but my 5 year old is in between the rides there. It looks like there is a section made for 0-4 and then it ramps up to 42\" inch rides that push the limit of what a 5 year old would want to get on. So my wife and I are not sold on that idea, we definitely don't want to sign up for a year at Knott's and keep thinking to ourselves how it is a second rate Disneyland. It'll just make us miss it even more.\n\n\nUniversal Studio and Magic Mountain are so far away from our house that it will never fill the void of sneaking out to Disneyland for a few hours as we live about 15 min from there and also both work in Anaheim. I'll definitely miss sneaking out of work early with her and just heading over to jump on some fast rides before picking up the kiddies.\n\n\nBefore this post gets too long let me give you guys and gals and opportunity to chime in. What would you all suggest I do to keep the family fun going with the family without Disneyland?\n\n\nThanks in advance. :)",

Perhaps the bar is too low with plans for a Disneyland expansion of Star Wars Land (SWL). Might I suggest Disneyland Resort (DLR) think bigger and go for that 3rd gate Star Wars Park.\n\n\nI worry that SWL will impact the already crowded Disneyland Park in a negative way. Disneyland is more popular than Disney California Adventure (DCA) and there are times when Disneyland will have to phase close its gates and DCA remains open. SWL will make Disneyland reach capacity more often. Annual Passholders may become disenchanted with not being able to visit the park in the evenings as SWL hype fills the parks all day. When that crest of hype settles, DLR might lose a huge chunk of their main AP clientele.\n\n\nThe idea that SWL will compete with Universal's Harry Potter is a gross understatement. Think of this... Star Wars has been a phenomenon since 1977. Someone who was 40-something in 1977 would be 80-something today. Toddlers are now getting into the Star Wars universe. That is nearly every single age demographic. How does that even remotely compare to Harry Potter? Right now, Season of the Force is quietly dominating Disneyland where we find Star Wars fans within the Disneyland Fanbase. TIE fighter projections in Space Mountain have made the wait times triple to up to 3 hours. The Star Tours update with an Ep VII scene results in remarkably longer now wait times as well. Imagine all those teens, parents, grandparents who are not necessarily Disney Parks people but would love to visit a Star Wars theme park. \n\n\nThematically, Star Wars is an ill fit in Disneyland. It is a whole universe of a franchise that is neither historical, pure adventure, Wild West frontier, or even realistically futuristic. Sacrificing the Rivers of America attractions for 18 months and stealing their real estate hurts and chokes a park that is on a remarkable roll from it's 60th anniversary entertainment shows. Sticking a SWL in the back seems like a forced afterthought. It will be successful but will it help Disneyland or maximize the investment into the DLR?\n\n\nA 3rd park would distribute the crowds and add capacity for the resort complex. Ideally, families could make DLR a week-long trip with 3 parks, 4 days (DL, DCA, Star Wars Park, DL, 2 travel days) with a rest day at the hotel or other LA touristy things. It seems like many try to just squeeze their visit into an extended weekend right now.\n\n\nDisneyland fans are only thinking very locally and seeing the the only adjacent properties. The problem is that these properties are small or extremely expensive. There could be private bus service to this park within a tolerable 20 minute commute from the Esplanade. Magic Kingdom to Animal Kingdom is 9 miles (20 minutes by Disney bus) apart in Florida for example.\n\n\nAngels Stadium commitment is up this year. There is 160 acres (same as the original Disneyland total area) only 3 miles away from the DLR complex ready to go this year. There many other 100+ acre sites within a reasonable bus distance. There could be a massive parking structure, hotel, and theme park. Disney does not have to link these by monorail but that would be ultra-cool too \ud83d\ude01.\n\n\nImagine with me... A roller coaster, vehicle flat rides, a theater, a body of water, dark rides, a real cantina (can't serve alcohol in DL), parades, night shows, fireworks to John Williams music... all possible to eat up crowds for a whole day.\n\n\nI saw this on Reddit awhile back...\n\nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9HOidMU.jpg\n\n\nThanks for reading. I'd love to hear your thoughts...",

If you are apart of the cast, crew, past or current we just want to wish you a heartfelt thank you for the time and effort you guys put into the show. Seeing the last performance with a host of former cast members in the audience with us was truly astounding. So many cheers, applause breaks, and laughs at all the right moments. Having never actually been apart of the show, we still found ourselves tearing up at the end. \n\n\nI think one of our favorite moments was when the genie listed off every single former Jafar, Aladdin, and Genie after he had made Jafar the Sultan.

  "title":"Girlfriend is enthusiastic in her desire for an annual pass. I'm not a big Disneyland fan, and am reluctant to purchase one. Any advice for me?",
  "text":"Just some background: I live roughly 15 minutes away from the park, and I've been there a handful of times in my life. I've always had a decent time, yet have never felt compelled or excited to return. I suppose I'm at least a minor fan of Disney and I have nothing against the park, yet I would be just fine if I never ended up visiting Disneyland again. \n\n\nMy girlfriend of almost three years, however, \nloves\n Disneyland. I took her there for her birthday last year, and quite honestly the vast majority of the fun I had stemmed from seeing her have a great time, and not necessarily from the park itself.\n\n\nWe recently learned that a good friend of mine and his girlfriend (who my girlfriend is fond of) both have annual passes and visit the park often, usually for short visits in the evenings to get a bite to eat or grab a drink. They told my girlfriend how worth it a Disneyland pass is, and that we should both get passes as well so we could all hang out together at the park. My girlfriend knows I don't see my friend that often anymore and this would give us an opportunity to hang out more frequently. She also is interested in becoming closer with my friend's girlfriend, as my girlfriend doesn't have much in the way of female friends and actually gets along with this girl. \n\n\nNow, both my friend and his girlfriend have well-paying jobs, which my girlfriend and I do not have. We're not living in poverty, but aren't swimming in money either. As you all know, annual passes aren't cheap, and immediately get labeled in my mind as an irresponsible use of money. For someone like myself who doesn't really care to visit Disneyland even if I could go for free, it's a tough sell. \n\n\nI spoke with my girlfriend, and she agrees that we'd of course need to fit the initial and monthly payments into our budget if we were to purchase passes. Even though she's being responsible and being very kind not to pressure me when I express hesitation, I know she has her heart set on an annual pass. I admit that it would also be nice to see more of my friend, and it's always a positive to see my girlfriend happy. \n\n\nTherefore, I suppose I just have a few questions:\n\n\nWould you, or do you, personally consider an annual pass a worthwhile investment (for yourself)? Why? \n\n\nDo you think my girlfriend and I, given the situation above, should find a way to get passes? \n\n\nWhat can I do to get more enjoyment out of visiting the park; what is it I'm not getting? \n\n\nThank you all in advance!",

  "text":"With construction underway for Star Wars Land and the rerouting of the Disneyland The Santa Fe & Disneyland Passenger Train (One of the Two Original Trains to Run in 1955), \nhere is a video briefly covering its history in the park, as well as where resides today. Features short cameos of Bob Gurr and Tony Baxter, two legendary Disney Imagineers.\n\n\nRailroad, the DLRR itself has halted passenger service around the park, with stationary locomotives of Engine No. 2 the E.P. Ripley and Engine No. 4 the Ernest E. marsh located at Main Street Station and New Orleans Square Station (Formerly the Frontierland Station) respectively. With the railroad currently put on standby as the tracks are being rerouted, I thought I'd take the time to share this video. It's a little old, but still a good video nonetheless.\n\n\nBack in 1955 Disneyland opened, and two of the attractions found at the park was the Disneyland Railroad, a 1\/8th scale 3 foot narrow gauge live steam railroad with two trains encircling the park; the Freight Train located over in Frontierland and the Passenger Train located at Main Street Station. The Passenger Train was pulled by the E.P. Ripley with the train itself consisting of one combine car, four passenger cars, and one observation car. They were painted in a yellow livery with dark green trimmings and rose red roofs. The passenger cars were constructed alongside the Freight Train cars and even the Mark Twain Riverboat over at the Disney Studios in Burbank, California and transported to the park one by one on flatbed trucks.\n\n\nBecause the railcars were of 1\/8th scale, the seats were rather small for adults, and with small windows and no air conditioning the passenger cars were known to become rather stuffy on hot days. They also took a very long time to load and unload due to the shape of the cars themselves. And when the Grand Canyon Diorama and Primeval World attraction opened, passengers on the left side of the locomotive we not able to see the diorama past the crowds of passengers and small windows on the right hand side. Soon enough the original Disneyland Passenger train was kept in the roundhouse and was only pulled out on peak days to alleviate crowds. The passenger cars were soon phased out for the more open air \"Holiday\" and \"Excursion\" cars you see on the railroad today, with the original passenger cars left in the roundhouse to collect dust and rot.\n\n\nAfter some time had passed and the cars themselves having fallen into disarray, some private collectors went ahead and bought five of the six original Disneyland coaches. The passenger cars went to a private collector in the San Luis Obispo County and the combine car going to the Carolwood Foundation. Both of these collectors have gone ahead and started to fully restore the original coaches back to the way they originally were when they ran on the Disneyland rails all the way back in 1955.\n\n\nOne car, however, remains and you can still see her in action. No. 106 The Grand Canyon Observation Car still resides in Disneyland today, but gone is the yellow paint and bench like seating inside. To celebrate America's Bicentennial in 1976, Lillian Disney and Disneyland overhauled the Observation Car into the elegant dark red and gold Lilly Belle Presidential Car as it is known today. The carpet inside the Lilly Belle uses the same carpeting found in Walt Disney's apartment above the Main Street Firehouse. The furniture inside is vintage and comes straight from the Queen Mary.\n\n\nWhile entirely repainted and redecorated, the Lilly Belle is still the Grand Canyon Observation Car underneath, and is coincidentally currently being pulled by its original engine, the E.P. Ripley at its original station of Main Street Station as the railroad is closed for the construction of Star Wars. So next time you visit Disneyland and walk through those turnstiles, look up and gaze at Main Street Station, even even get up close and personal to some surviving relics of Disneyland's original past.",

  "title":"\"Opening the Park\" show. Did there used to be one?",
  "text":"Hey all! I had been trying to research this but haven't had much luck - most of the results come up for Disneyland Paris.\n\n\nBut last year I had finally gotten to Disneyland for the first time in my life, and loved it. In my opinion, Anaheim had the better, more up to date versions of most of the rides, and the size of the parks wasn't nearly as intimidating (and my feet hurt less). I had no complaints about Disneyland compared to Walt Disney World, which is (or was!) the park I considered \"home.\"\n\n\nThere is one thing that Magic Kingdom in Orlando had that I always love to see that Disneyland didn't have however, and that was the opening ceremony in the morning - those of you who have seen it know what I'm talking about, but there are videos on youtube if you're curious. The Mayor of Main Street comes out to open the park for the day, there's some dancing, the train, some characters....\n\n\n... I digress. \nMy question is\n did Disneyland used to have something like that? I mean, I imagine if they used to it's something they got rid of when they opened California Adventure - a morning show to watch at the other side of the Esplanade would distract people lining up for the other park. Or did they just never have one? Is the train station not elevated enough to allow it to be a stage that people can see over the ticket booths?\n\n\nI'm dreadfully curious - it seems strange that Walt Disney World would have such a show, but Disneyland wouldn't. Is it something that originated in Anaheim first?",

We certainly don't want the whole \"Under New Management\" mess that came with the WDW update, but the Tiki Room at Tokyo Disneyland worked well, except that it is an almost completely new script. It worked in Tokyo because they had to record a full Japanese-language show, but I for one don't want to lose the voices of the hosts.\n\n\nAnd so here's my idea:\n\n\n\n\nRebuild the fountain to the dimensions of the Tokyo Disneyland Tiki Room:\n\n\n\n\nBefore\n\n\nAfter\n\n\nThe goal here is to give it enough room inside to store an animatronic. In Tokyo that \nholds Stitch\n. I'd wager with current technology and some hydraulics it could even be rigged to run the traditional fountain for part of the show, and then pop up the animatronic for the second part.\n\n\n\n\nRemove the Hawaiian Lullaby element from the show. Clip from \"Ladies and gentlemen, now we present direct from the islands, a musical luau!\" until the drums start playing.\n\n\n\n\nReplace the missing segment with the song Lava, sung by a pair of animatronic volcanoes! The whole top of the fountain could have the volcano rising up, rotating around so the whole audience could see, singing. Then he descends as he spends years alone, only his face showing. As the female volcano rises, a door opens in the male animatronic to make room, she rises to full height, sings her verse, then in a flash of light and mist the male volcano returns to full height, with them now blended together (the door in the male animatronic allows for the female to fit in) they sing the finale (again rotating so everyone gets to see), and then they descend back into the fountain and the water returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'd say this gives a new pull to the Tiki Room, gives a more modern tie-in, while at the same time preserving the original outside of the luau song and leaves the host voices untouched. What gets added isn't some annoying non-polynesian birds, but instead a great Hawaiian song. Of course, with Moana so close on the horizon, I doubt we'll see any changes in the near future, since they would want to leverage that potential tie-in as well. \n\n\nFun to play Imagineer though!",

A cast member was near by and had kind of heard of the situation as we had to leave at that moment to pack and head to San Diego. She told us to go to the front of the park to customer service and let them know our situation. We did so and they were very nice and re issued us new complementary 2-day tickets that we could use anytime in the next 2 years. We were very grateful for this as we weren't expecting anything like this. Well we wanted to make sure we used the tickets and just booked our trip for a few months before they expire. Unfortunately 2 of our friends that are in the group won't be able to attend because they are pregnant and will have just had their new born. My question is, do you think if we talk to a rep at Disney will they allow 2 other friends to be able to use those tickets although the original Two's names are on them. We would like them to be used and not go to waste. Any suggestions are welcome, thought i'd ask on here early on before i start calling departments or when we get down there we visit the customer service again. Thank you\n\n\nTL;TR: Have 2-day comp tickets with one group of friends names on  them but they won't be able to use them as they just will have had a newborn.

Do these really exist and how do you access them?\n\n\nAlso on Indiana Jones I saw 2 groups of people take the elevator up then down to bypass a (small) part of the line. One group was 2 teenagers that ran to the elevator so it didn't appear that they couldn't walk up stairs. Are the elevators for handicapped people or is this some type of special line?\n\n\nMater's Junkyard- we were standing by the exit watching the ride, and multiple people got in line (at the exit!) and were let through the gate to (seemingly) bypass the line. I didn't see if they showed the CM anything, but my sister in law told me she had seen similar things happen on other rides. And these people were not let into a \"viewing area\" to watch their kids ride, they went straight to the line. Anyone know how they did that?\n\n\nAll this could just be nothing but I got really intrigued when I heard someone ask about the \"secret rider line\"!",

  "title":"First time in Disneyland as an actual adult! What can I do that I couldn't as a kid?",
  "text":"Hi all! So a few weeks ago my mom surprised me with an incredible graduation gift: a three day trip to Disneyland with my boyfriend! I was really surprised and super grateful. She knows I'm a big Disney person. I've done all my research and I know which rides to get on first and whatnot, but I'm more curious about what activities might be more fun for adults. I'll be 22, my boyfriend will be 23, so we're both of drinking age. He's not as big a Disney person as I am, but he's excited for a free vacation. \n\n\nSo here are my questions: what kinda of fun things are there to do at DLR and in the very nearby area. We're staying at Hotel Indigo, so we're within walking distance because we won't have a car with us. We'll be arriving June 12th in the afternoon, then we're spending all of the 13th, 14th, and 15th in the parks before catching a plane on the evening of the 16th. Are there any fun things we can do in the area that aren't Disney on those interim days? Maybe some good restaurants? Also, I know summer is supposed to be swamped, but is Monday-Wednesday in early June really all that bad? We're going either way, too late to change reservations, but it'd be nice to be prepared. We're planning on taking breaks to the hotel in the early afternoon and coming back in the evenings to avoid the heat and the crowds.\n\n\nWe're treating ourselves to one extra nice meal in the parks, but we're going to aim to do meals mostly outside (sandwiches, pizza, whatever). That brings me to my next question! What is (in your opinion) the best \"nice\" place to eat? I want to make reservations at a restaurant in the resort, but I haven't decided which. From what I read the Blue Bayou has great atmosphere, but mediocre food. Carthay has a nice atmosphere and pretty good food. Which do you all like best? I'm kind of torn, honestly. Are there any other places in missing?\n\n\nFinally, what are some cool non-ride related things to do in the park? My boyfriend is not super big on rides, but he has promised to go on any dark ride or simulator, plus one roller coaster of my choosing. We have park hoppers, so it's no issue to jump from park to park. Are there any especially cool shows or bands to watch? The boyfriend is definitely more of a \"sit back and drink a beer while listening to cool jams\" guy while I'm more of a \"LETS GO ON EVERY SINGLE RIDE\" lady. \n\n\nThe last time I went to Disney was when I was 14 (Grad nite doesn't count, it was AWFUL), so I really want to make this vacation special! Any help is appreciated! Thank you \ud83d\udc9c",

  "title":"What Disneyland Means to Me",
  "text":"When I went to Disneyland for the first time (the only time so far, but it\u2019ll happen again), I was 11. I had horrible buck teeth that I was always laughed at and belittled for, and I had never really fit in, switching schools twice before I found a place where I felt at least a little accepted.\n\n\nBut that didn\u2019t matter, because to me, Disneyland isn\u2019t a place. It\u2019s not a theme park. It\u2019s a concept; almost a state of mind. It\u2019s a metaphor for everything good in the world. You see, when I first walked into Disneyland, it was like I had found that place over the rainbow. The details of the park and the happiness that was within it completely erased all the insecurities I had. I might not have been intelligent enough to have an adult conversation with the man who worked in the magic store, but I was still worth talking to, and still worth being shown how to do tricks with cards. For the first time in my life, I felt totally and completely accepted, and for the first time, I felt truly happy.\n\n\nTo me, the park provided some form of escape from the real world, and it became a certain paradise for me. Every single aspect of the park was made perfectly, to the point where it felt like it went forever and nothing existed outside of it. I had no responsibilities, no worries, and my mind was completely cleared from everything outside of the pure happiness that was surrounding me. Time itself felt like it had stopped \u2014 I didn\u2019t tell the time in 12 or 24 hours, but rather by how long it\u2019d be until I was at the front of the ride queue.\n\n\nAfter that trip, it sparked something for me. I\u2019ve now got a love for rollercoasters and theme parks; I constantly play games like RollerCoaster Tycoon and Thrillville: Off the Rails (which I remember playing in Tomorrowland).\n\n\nI\u2019d do anything to stand at the beginning of Main Street, USA again. I can\u2019t wait until the day I have kids who can stand there, so that I can see the excitement and happiness on their faces as they go through the same feelings that I felt. Those feelings, I believe, are the main part of Disneyland. For some, it\u2019s simply a collection of rides. But for me, it was much more \u2014 it\u2019s a goal, or a mindset. So next time you go, think of me. Take a step back from the rides and look around at all the little details, and think about how that place can give even the littlest kid the biggest sense of belonging and happiness. That\u2019s what I believe the \u201cmagic\u201d in Disneyland is. It\u2019s the only place I know of that can have that effect on someone, which I think is pretty amazing. Disneyland\u2019s a 14 hour, very expensive flight away from me, which is why I haven\u2019t been for a while. But it\u2019ll happen \u2014 I\u2019ve well and truly caught the Disney bug, and even after 8 years away from the Happiest Place on Earth, it\u2019s still just as strong as ever.",

Getting a high score on this attraction is best with another player.\n\n\nIf you've ridden this attraction before, you know how hard this game is on your arm (especially for females...). DO NOT DO ANYTHING DURING THE PRACTICE SCENE. Save your energy for the ending.\n\n\nFarm Scene\n: \n\n\n\"Get that Fox Out of the Hen House!\" No seriously, Hamm isn't joking. That fox scares several 1,000-point chickens out, fresh for firing. The fox reappears several times, so keep your eye out.\n\n\nHit the gophers on the bottom, then focus on the two pigs to reveal a cat. Keep repeating this to raise the cats score to 500,1000,2000,2000,2000.\n\n\nThe hardest target of the game is the small rat atop the barn at the top of the screen. This flips the barn, revealing several more high-valued rats.\n\n\nDino Darts\n:\n\n\nif you shoot the center lava balloon then the three that replace it, high point balloons will shoot out of the volcano. Then, if you shoot the two meteors that appear on the left and right three times, high point balloon meteors will begin raining down.\n\n\nArmy Plates\n:\n\n\nAim for the 2,000-point plates that will appear in the upper corners of the screen. If you and the other rider both break those plates at the same time, a row of additional 2,000-point plates will appear.\n\n\nA tank appears in the middle of the screen that will throw 5,000-point plates.\n\n\nBuzz's Flying Tossers\n:\n\n\nYou and your partner must lasso all the LGMs on the rocket in the middle of the screen, spawning a monster you could hit for 500, then 1,000, points a shot. THIS IS VERY VERY HARD AND WILL REQUIRE PRACTICE. If an alien pops back up from the ship, it\u2019s over. This is a good one to just start pulling before the game even starts.\n\n\nIf you're alone, hit the 1,000- and 2,000-point LGMs at the side of the screen. Hit enough of these, and there's a small 5,000-point LGM in the upper corner, too.\n\n\nWoody's Rootin' Tootin' Shootin' Gallery\n:\n\n\nThis is the hardest scene to shoot for a high score. 500-point targets will spawn more 1,000-point targets, so aim for those first. Try clearing the middle first, then the bottom gopher, then the two buildings, then the barrel, then the remainders.\n\n\nDon't stop shooting as your car moves. Aim lower for 1,000- and 2,000-point targets. Two 500's will reveal a 2,000.\n\n\nMine Carts:\n\n\nFirst, hit the 1,000-point bat as soon as it appears. That will spawn a 5,000-point bat for the taking. Then, have you and your partner hit the same target to boost the score as high as 5,000.",

I'm usually one to plan trips way farther in advance than this, but it ended up working out that this is pretty much the only time we are going to be able to go.\n\n\nIt's just my husband and I, coming from Canada.  We visited WDW in August fior our honeymoon and had an absolute blast, but neither of us has been to Disneyland in 10 years or so, so I really don't remember how everything works and whatnot.  I've been doing lots of reading over the last couple days, but I'm still not sure exactly what our best plan is.\n\n\nFirst of all I would love some hotel suggestions.  We are looking to do this as cheaply as we can (stupid Canadian dollar), but would love to stay somewhere within half a mile or so of the park that isn't absolutely terrible (doesn't need to be amazing, but decent and clean would be great.)  \n\n\nWe are thinking about doing 4 park days (one CA, three DL), no parkhopper to save a bit of money.  I'm not too worried about dining (my husband is a chef and I also work in the supplier side of the industry, so food is our lives.  I'm okay having a trip away from that where we can just eat hotdogs, ha!)  Is 4 days going to be enough?\n\n\nI'm also slightly confused about the Fastpasses at DL.  Obviously I'm familiar with FP+ at WDW, which I know is completely different.  Are there kiosks around the park that offer Fastpasses, or do you get them from the rides themselves?\n\n\nIf has any other money\/time saving tips for us that would be fabulous!  I am SO excited to go back to Disneyland after so many years.  That and we will finally be somewhere that people will recognize our Haunted Mansion tattoos!",

While I am highly active on this subreddit (I like to check it at least 3 times a day, but sometime things happen), I'm not here every moment. We don't usually remove posts without reasons. If your post is removed, \/u\/DisneylandMod will reply with either what rule your broke, or redirecting you to an already open thread.\n\n\nThere is also a new reporting system in place. You can now report with specific rule violations.\n\n\n\n\nDaily discussion topics\n: you may notice that Wednesday and Thursdays have been missed the past month or two. AutoModerator is having a few issues here and there and we're trying to get it all worked out. I do try to have \/u\/DisneylandMod post, but sometimes I miss the mornings.\n\n\nI have been noticing that Mondays are a quiet day for our Rumor Round Up post, and we got a complaint or two about Friday's and Saturday's being too similar. If we were to rebrand these days, would you have any topic ideas?\n\n\n\n\nThe \nFAQ\n is almost done. We did have a few volunteers but some fell through, so I'm struggling to write them all. If you can help with any of the topics below, please let me know and I'll add you to the wiki page. You'll get some special flair for helping out!\n\n\nFirst Time Vists\n\n\nCan't Miss\/Must Do\n\n\nOff Property Hotels\n\n\nTickets\n\n(This needs an update about the new Peak day pricings)\n\n\nCelebrations at Disneyland\n\n\nEntertainment Offerings\n\n\nDisneyland for Teens\n\n\nDisneyland for Adults\n\n\nDisneyland while Pregnant\n\n(This is one of the big ones I need help with. I've never experienced being pregnant in general...)\n\n\nDisneyland with Disabilites\n\n\nIf I can't get this up and running by the next State of the Subreddit, I'll boot the \"FAQ Redo\" on Sundays back up again. Also, if there are any topics you'd like to see, please let me know!\n\n\n\n\nIf you've been with this community for a long time, try to count how many times you've seen \"Any tips\/tricks?\" type \nhelp topics\n. A little crazy, right? We've received a ton of complaints about this in the past and we're developing a new system for \"Help!\" topics to avoid these vague questions. \n\n\nIt's called a schedule, where the user requesting help must have a general layout of their plans. \/u\/kellyfish22 had an \nexcellent example of a post\n a few days ago. She told us what she was celebrating, who she was coming with, what attractions she wanted to hit, and what\/where she wanted to eat. In my years of moderation, I don't think I've ever seen that many comments on a help post. \n\n\nWe do realize that most people who ask for help are new to the subreddit and likely won't see this state of the subreddit, but \/u\/DisneylandMod will be removing the vague posts and redirecting them to the FAQ and asking for a general itinerary.\n\n\n\n\nToday we're launching our \nReddit Live \nMeetups\n Thread\n again, since it was \nrequested a few months back\n. You'll notice it as our primary sticky, only removed when we need to use both sticky places, such as when our State of the Subreddit is up, any contests, or Megathreads. \n\n\nThis is currently a test. If the thread is active we will keep it up permanently.\n\n\nThe above is for casual meetups at the parks. Official meetups are few and far between, since they're usually run by me and I work 4 jobs (freelance production life!). I am hoping to hold an official one on \nDapper Day\n, which is May 1st this year.\n\n\n\n\nWe've also finally debuted some \nnew flair\n! Color schemes have changed, but if you don't like the colors chosen, let us know and we'll make some changes. If you'd like flair from a missing land, please let us know and we'll add it to the list.\n\n\nCast Members, you may request Cast Member flair. We can either verify that you are a CM with \/r\/disneycastmember or you may message us proof. That being said, consider yourself on the clock. Don't be dumb and start giving out information from the Hub and such. You may also request \"Former Cast Member\" flair if you are no longer employed by the company.\n\n\n\n\nOkay, I think that's about it for this season! Any questions or concerns, please comment down below! :D",

Yesterday, one of the full time artists, Steven, was working, and it wasn't busy so he spent about 15 minutes with us and told us about his life story!\n\n\nIt turns out his wife is also a silhouette artist, and they worked at Tokyo Disneyland together for over 20 years (just returned to Anaheim 3 years ago) He told us (and showed us pictures!) of hid travels around Japan--chasing the cherry blossoms and the map for Tokyo Disney Sea.\n\n\nI know it's been said before, but the silhouette studio is an underrated gem of the resort. $10 for a silhouette and you get to experience the mastery of these artists like Steven!",

  "title":"Massive timesaver if you like getting good coffee as soon as you enter DCA (and a bonus unrelated timesaver for the Disneyland side)",
  "text":"I just spent 3\/20, 3\/21 and 3\/22 in the parks by myself. It was more crowded than I had ever seen it! I've done this trip many times on these dates, and I'm always looking for ways to save chunks of time.\n\n\nIf you're like me, when you enter the parks your first agenda is to get a high quality caffeinated bevvy. Last year I went to the Starbucks in each park as my first mission. Lots of other people have the same agenda! It's hard to brave the security line, then the ticket gate line only to get into a really long coffee line. But now, at least for the DCA side, NEVER AGAIN.\n\n\nWhen you enter the DCA park, don't go to Fiddler Fifer and Practical! (do peek in there though to see how much time I'm about to save you.) The timesaving tip?\n\n\nGO TO GHIRARDELLI CHOCOLATE AT PACIFIC PIER. You won't even have to hurry. They have lattes, mochas and coffee. THE WHITE MOCHA IS TO DIE FOR. You'll be sipping it within minutes.\n\n\nOn the day I discovered this, 03\/21, the security line was longer than I had ever seen it, and the esplanade was literally full with lines for the ticket gates (mostly for the Disneyland side gates.) But when I got into DCA and went to Ghirardelli, I was served immediately and there were only 5 people in there.\n\n\nBOOM, I just saved you 30 or more minutes.\n\n\nThe bonus tip is regarding the Matterhorn. There's a little known single rider line for it. Go to the exit on the fantasyland side and get a card from the cast member. THEY ALWAYS NEED SINGLE RIDERS AND SEAT THEM VERY QUICKLY. I waltzed past a 45 minute standby line at the busiest time of the day and entered a bobsled within 5 minutes. Later in the day they weren't doing it on the fantasyland side but I noticed cast members at the tomorrowland side. They were doing it there! Again, I skipped a 45 minute standby line and was in a sled within 2 minutes. The tomorrowland side will pummel your body - it's amazingly rough, but they just added seat padding so it's a lot better. In fact, I used to skip the matterhorn on every trip - but now I'm hopping on it every time I walk past it.",

  "title":"My Experience with Social Clubs",
  "text":"Hey there, \n\/u\/trulygoofy\n asked me to elaborate on my experience with social clubs. Thought maybe anyone else who has dabbled in them could share as well since they aren't really popular among this sub. \n\n\nI looked for a club back in May to join because I went to the parks every weekend and always had trouble finding someone to go with. I just wanted friends, basically, and I thought maybe the social clubs would be a great way to interact with people. Well anyways, I contacted one and they wanted to meet me in the parks to get to know me better. Ironically, I should have seen this as somewhat of a warning sign - I was walking in Pizza Port and I was exiting and accidentally bumped into someone. I apologized quickly it wasn't intentional, but of course it was someone from another club and they threw a hissy fit over it. \"WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING\" all offended. My bad. Kinda rude and unfriendly, but not at all clubs act that way, I'm sure. I showed up and most of the members were very, very welcoming. Super friendly and my ideal for the kinda people I was looking to go with. The club leader person was my main issue. The first time I met with everyone the leader person went over \"rules.\" Told me I would be a \"prospect\" for about 2-3 months until they see I'm making a real \"effort\" with the club. (What was I supposed to do? Show up in biker attire and ask Mickey if he needs me to order a hit on Goofy Sons of Anarchy style?) Then I was told how I need to be respectful and yada, yada. Totally fine, no issue, whatever.  I wasn't really feeling the vibe that the person set because it was more of like a \"I'm head honcho in this club\" kinda deal, as opposed to this is a group of friends who just go to Disney. Weird vibes.\n\n\nSo anyways, hung with them and I just felt like I had to prove something to them instead of just being friends hanging at the park. It was hard because the whole club had been friends for so long, too. I met some cool people in clubs who were extremely friendly and some leaders who didn't give off that same vibe. The one issue though still was when I was hanging with them the leader person refused to even say hello to me or even act like I was within the group. I looked into different groups and some make you pass tests and other stuff that just kind of takes out the experience of Disney. I go to to Disney because I enjoy it and feel 100% at peace when I'm there. I don't go to prove something to one group of people. While I think the social clubs are a good thought, I don't think most are in the right sense of mind and come off with a lot of entitlement. I don't know, it's just not my kinda scene.\n\n\nAnybody else here try a social club or have experiences with them?",

  "title":"[Discussion] Tomorrowland, world of the future",
  "text":"So I get that Tomorrowland is playing host to star wars until the new land opens up, but I'm hoping that afterwards we'll be able to see some new rides established there. What would you like to see? Personally I'd like to see the actual world of tomorrow. I feel like it's less Tomorrowland and more \"spaceland\" between star tours, astro blasters, astro orbiter, and space mountain. I know it's hard to keep things steady with the ever changing and evolving future and space is a safe bet and exciting, but I think it would be cool to branch out more. Maybe have a ride where you're touring a robotics lab and something goes awry, or one similar to adventure through inner space where they shrink you down and have you do battle with microorganisms, or add education about new undersea discoveries to finding nemo. Don't take it out, just establish a way to have dory and marlin add different narrations, and include animations of new life on the digital display. There's the Pacific science center up here in Seattle and it's managed to stay relevant despite the ever changing face of science, and they don't have nearly the resources and budget of Disneyland.\n\n\nThere was a micechat posted earlier of a ranty complainer talking about how they ruined Disneyland by taking out all Walt's stuff. I don't think he was right, and his point of view sucks, but I think that he hadn't fully formed what his problem was. The largest problem I've had with Tomorrowland is how much education they've taken out of it. Walt's vision for that land was a place to educate and celebrate the advances of the future. And yes, it still holds a little bit of that, but I feel like they could be trying so much harder. Rather than leaving the captain Eo theater empty except for movie previews, they could be including 4D experiences about our planet and others out there. Rather than throwing in rides about buzz lightyear because he comes from space, they should be looking to make more original attractions, and add cool cameos from buzz lightyear like they did with POTC. I just feel like there's so much more room for expansion there and it's being wasted. My hope is for a nice remodel after Star Wars land opens, like they did in DCA after Cars Land opened to make the rest of the park viable. What are your thoughts? Any cool ride ideas? Am I just crazy?\n\n\nAnd as an afterthought, do we know what's happening with Star Tours? I feel like it would be weird to leave it where it is, on the opposite side of the park from the rest of its franchise.....",

My friend and I did 3 single-park days; 2 in DL and 1 in DCA. I could list all the rides and shows we packed into our 3 days, but most of you know what all that\u2019s like. One of the things that struck me the most about our visit was how welcome and special I felt, even as an adult. The Cast Members really are the heart and soul of the parks and they made some magical experiences possible for us:\n\n\nCM Genna let us sneak in to DL early to take photos by the Mickey flower arrangement. She later invited us back in to help open the park. \n\n\nI rolled my ankle ever so slightly in DL on our first day (yes, I was running, and yes, it was towards the Dapper Dans). I was hoping to visit the nurse in DCA on our second day for a tensor and\/or an ice pack. We lined up at the gates early for regular entry, but CM and manager Steven invited us to visit the nurse right away and enjoy the park with the Extra Magic Hour guests. CM Anthony also made our night as we waited for World of Colour to start, encouraging us to ask as many questions as we liked and offering hugs as needed. He kept our group in good spirits while we waited for the show to start.\n\n\nDare I say it - I even fell in love for a brief moment while on the Tower of Terror. A dark-eyed bellhop with a stone-cold poker face stole my heart. I rode again immediately afterwards with a second FP my friend wasn\u2019t going to use. I was even directed towards the line for the same elevator. But alas - when the elevator doors opened, he was gone. Perhaps he's trapped in the Twilight Zone.\n\n\nMy friend also found love during the Captain America meet and greet. They have plans to make their relationship official very soon ;).\n\n\nAll in all, it was a fantastic trip. I've been using my new \nWinnie the Pooh honey pot mug\n for all my drinking needs and enjoying the content on this subreddit. I'll treasure the new Disney memories I've made and anticipate those that are yet to come.

  "title":"Thoughts on the Autopia refurb",
  "text":"I had a chance to check out Autopia over the weekend for the first time in about a year. \n\n\nThe Queue\n\n\nI can't speak to what changes have been made to the queue itself as the last time I checked it out, I didn't go through the extended queue. But, I did like the vintage videos playing on the screens throughout the queue, though I'm not sure how new those may be. I did like the color scheme throughout the queue, much more appealing than the queue that was in place last year. I feel that this fits a lot more with Tomorrowland than the old steam punk color scheme did, so that's a plus. \n\n\nThe Vehicles\nSome of the cars themselves have been updated, but not all of them. For one, some of the cars have been painted with legitimately nice paint that you'd see on a new vehicle. The headlights have been replaced with decals, and looks a lot cleaner than the old headlights (which looked like the headlights from Porsche's in the 60's). Tail lights & the rear bumper look a lot more modern and also have been replaced with decals.  There is also a spoiler that's been placed on the vehicle, but it almost looks like a head rest.\n\n\nThe Attraction\nI haven't been on this attraction enough to spot the differences in the track, but the ride vehicles themselves were much better than the last time I went on this attraction. The vehicle didn't stall like it did before, and made for a much more enjoyable ride. I was hoping we'd see some electric vehicles there instead, but maybe some day.\n\n\nI think this attraction has been greatly improved and I thought it was enjoyable for what it is. I hope they'll take the next step & introduce electric cars but I don't think we'll be seeing that any time soon. \n\n\nTL;DR color scheme & vehicles have been updated, look a lot more aesthetically pleasing, but probably not much else.",

When last we went I made sure that by time we got to the bag check, our stuff was all up on the table, unzipped and ready for inspection to speed things along and make life easy for the CMs doing the check and the legion of folks behind us in that line. \n\n\nBut I've heard from folks chatting (here and elsewhere) that everybody needs to empty every bag upon entry now? We are a family of four that travels pretty heavy into the park (diapers, wipes, food for the kids, plenty of water and other essentials in multiple backpacks\/bags) So am I going to have to be prepared to dump out every bag we take in every time we enter or leave the Esplanade? That will definitely make me think twice about hitting up Downtown Disney once we're past security for the rest of the day. :P \n\n\nAlso, what's up with the metal detectors? Is this like a secondary security screening or do they just make you walk through something and send you on your way? \n\n\nI hope this doesn't come off like I'm trying to circumvent security or something...

(Dumbo would be magically moved over, or there would be an entrance alongside Monstro, next to his eye, that led down to a space excavated beneath Casey Jr and Dumbo.)  The restaurant \"Kronos\" would be themed to the cavern where Bob found Gazerbeam on Nomanisan Island. If you were clever, you might spy Gazerbeam's body through a crack in the wall and if you turned around and lined up just right you could see a secret phrase burned onto the rocks behind you.  Drones searching for guests would flit in and out (could be projected or on wires maybe?). The atmosphere would be cool and musty. Perhaps it could incorporate viz effects from the rocket bay (a gantry? a nose cone?).  We can see flickers from the fast-moving Nomanisan Monorail as it zooms above us on elevated rails.

I'm having trouble deciding between these two options, so maybe some kind folk with experience can give me their point of view:\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I are going to the parks June 13th-15th (just one month away!), and we decided that we're going to have one nice dinner in the parks. When I say \"we decided\" I mostly mean me, because he's pretty cool with wherever we eat, as long as there's food. So I made reservations for the Bayou on the 13th for a late dinner, but then I came across the World of Color package and that seems like a great option! \n\n\nBoth the Bayou and most of the dining options for WOC look like they'll be around the same price per person (considering you're getting an app and dessert with the WOC package as well), and the food looks like it's all stuff I'd eat. I'm not 100% on the Wine Country Trattoria (Not much of a wine person, and I've grown up in that area of California anyway), but Ariel's Grotto looks right up my alley. \n\n\nI also read some stuff online that suggested it can be hard to find a good place to stand for WOC, and being kind of short, not being able to see things is pretty important to me. \n\n\nSo I'm stumped! I've never eaten at any of these restaurants and I can only choose one. Does anyone have any personal opinion on which restaurant is better? If the Blue Bayou is better, does the bonus of having preferred seating for World of Color make up for it? Also, how good is World of Color? Is preferred seating really much better than Fastpass seating? It's been a while since I've been to DLR, so I want to make this trip really special.

  "title":"Annual pass prices by the numbers",
  "text":"A growing trend I have seen on both Disneyland and Walt Disney World forums is the general complaint about annual ticket prices. I always found this odd as when you run the numbers, even at higher prices, Disney Parks remain one of the lowest cost entertainment options out there. So I figured I would post and back this claim up with numbers. \n\n\nDisneyland Annual Passport:\n\n\n\n\nSouthern California Select - $329 per year - 170 days - $1.93 per day\n\n\nDeluxe - $599 per year - 315 days - $1.90 per day\n\n\nSignature - $849 per year - 350 Days - $2.42 per day\n\n\nSignature Plus - $1,049 per year - 365 Days - $2.87 per day\n\n\nPremier - $1,486 per year - 365 Days - $4.07 per day\n\n\n\n\nI don't think it is reasonable that someone will go every day their park pass is open so those day rates are a bit misleading. But even without that, check out some other entertainment options below to see how much more it is, not just per event but per year as well!\n\n\nAngels Season Tickets -- One of the least expensive teams to get season tickets for too, so prices only go up from here!\n\n\n\n\nUpper View - $483 per year - 69 games - $7.60 per game\n\n\nAll Star View - $621 per year - 69 games - $9.00 per game\n\n\nView MVP - $1,587 per year - 69 games - $23 per game\n\n\nDiamond Mvp - $13,455 per year - 69 games - $195 per game\n\n\n\n\nI don't think most people would hit all 69 games either, so that per-game price is also not super accurate. Even so, their lowest cost option is still more than a Disney Parks option that offers well over 2x the number of available days to go. Of course, maybe sports are not your thing. How about the Opera?\n\n\nLos Angeles Opera Season Tickets:\n\n\n\n\nObstructed view - $105 per year - 6 shows - $17.50 per show\n\n\nRear Balcony - $182 per year - 6 shows - $30 per show\n\n\nFront Balcony - $247 per year - 6 shows - $41 per show\n\n\nOrchestra Ring - $587 per year - 6 shows - $97 per show\n\n\nCenter Orchestra - $1297 per year - 6 shows - $216 per show\n\n\nPremier Orchestra - $1456 per year - 6 shows - $242 per show\n\n\n\n\nAt the opera you can indeed get an annual ticket that costs less than a Disney park ticket. But your seat will suck (they even tell you it will be obstructed in the ticket title). Maybe you don't care, however, typically the people who complain about ticket prices at Disney also complain about upcharge services like premium parking, or you know, paying more for a non-obstructed seat. You also only have an option to go 6 times per year, so while your yearly out of pocket is lower, what you can do is also a lot lower. \n\n\nOr maybe all of this isn't your cup of tea. Instead you would prefer go to the movies! Lets assume a ticket price of $7.00 as you'll be going to an off-peak, non-opening show. And lets do that 1 time per week for the year.\n\n\n\n\n$7.00\/show - 52 shows - $364\/year\n\n\n\n\nYou could actually get a Disney SoCal Select pass for less than the cost of 1 movie for 1 person per year at $7.00. In reality this isn't fair because a ticket is likely closer to $15\/show for a non-premium show. Premium IMAX shows are closer to $20\/show which would cost you more than a Disney Premier passport in 1 year. The big difference is that your movie will last about 2 hours whereas you could go to a Disney park and stay there all day.\n\n\nThis isn't to say any of these options are inexpensive. And frankly it is easy to lie with numbers and make them say whatever you want. I listed the raw data so you can look at how often you would go to each event and see how it breaks down in your own life. Maybe Disney costs less, maybe more... But I think you'll find it stacks up with other entertainment options much better than originally thought. In my opinion Disney Parks are not priced unfairly for what they give you.\n\n\nAnyhow, there are some numbers and data. Hopefully you find some of it interesting.",

I haven't come across this question yet anywhere online, so I'm curious to see if anyone might have any idea how Disneyland would treat me if I were to purchase a SoCal AP before I get my license from the CA DMV.

Screamin - just saves time.  Radiator Springs Racers - saves time, and you always wind up with a \"window seat\" on the left.  Soarin - eh, maybe worth it.\n\n\n\n\nTrying to find a Mickey bar after 5 PM is a challenge.\n\n\n\n\nIt was High School Grad weekend.  Pretty crowded about noon to 8, then they all left.\n\n\n\n\nI took a bazillion (I counted p;) photos for people.  Don't know why I kept getting asked but I was happy to oblige.\n\n\n\n\nZOMG - the crowds in Magic Kingdom for the first evening parade and fireworks are insane!\n\n\n\n\nI lost every race in Radiator Springs races.  0 for 9\n\n\n\n\nI always thought Fillmore only said \"We're all visitors on this planet\" in RS racers, but there is a second phrase he and Sarge use.  I couldn't understand what it was, though.  Anyone know?\n\n\n\n\nI really expected the Preview building near the Trattoria in California Adventure would have had a Star Wars preview, but it was closed.\n\n\n\n\nIt's a good time to be a Star Wars or Marvel geek.\n\n\n\n\nLou Mongello (wdw radio) said to ride radiator Springs racers after dark.  I decided to give it a try, and was amazed.  Not only were the colors much brighter, but when I entered the enclosed space, my eyes were adjusted to the dark.  I was able to see the cactus, trees, railroad building (there is writing on it!) and so much more detail than I had ever seen before.  Give it a try!\n\n\n\n\nThe Village Theater shows were unexpectedly terrific!  They performed Beauty and the Beast and Tangled while I was there.\n\n\n\n\nBecause I had the time, I managed to build myself an R2D2 droid (finally!) and that is my souvenir for this trip.\n\n\n\n\nSoarin' was still open, but I guess they are out of orange scent.  There were no scents at all, but still a good show.\n\n\n\n\nJohn Lasseter always wear Pixar themed Hawai'in shirts but they are never for sale anywhere I have found.\n\n\n\n\nThe Anaheim bus system is terrible.  The less said about it, the better.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, and not to brag, but I was the high scorer in my car for every round of Buzz Lightyear :)",

  "text":"Just saw the show for he first time. As others have said, it's no Aladdin, but it's good. \n\n\nMy showing had lots of tech issues. Whoever was running the spotlights was way, way, way off. Particularly during Let It Go. Elsa was totally dark for multiple sections, only for the spotlight to swing back to her location for a moment before she moved again and the cycle repeated. It happened enough during that song that people started laughing at it. When Elsa sings \"Here I stand\" in total darkness 10' away from an empty spotlighted area, it's funny. The spotlight issues continued throughout the show, but improved. \n\n\nLots of mic issues too--mics off when they should be on, mice on when they should be off. Lots of popping and rustling from the costumes. \n\n\nAll stuff that can be smoothed over as they get comfortable. I'm not worried about that stuff. \n\n\nThe acting was good, as was the singing. There are definitely spaces where they can start getting some genie-esque humor into the show (though not as much as in Aladdin), but they need to work out the kinks first. \n\n\nMy biggest issue was the staging. Unlike Aladdin, which made use of the full stage and was very dynamic, most of the choreography and staging had the actors centered onstage. I think the projection technology limits how much they can go side-to-side without it looking weird, but it's definitely something I noticed. \n\n\nI won't be back til the fall and I look forward to seeing how this evolves. I know I compared it a lot to Aladdin here and it doesn't stack up, but taken on its own, it's a good time.",

My fianc\u00e9 and I visit the parts at least once a year for a week and we see this all the time.  \n\n\nOn our last visit, we had some time to kill, so we spent time playing the carnival games at paradise pier.  I think we were doing the horse race and water gun games mostly.  We realized the stuffed animals would be fun to bring home as chew toys for our dogs, so we started collecting them.  We have 3 dogs and had secured (undefeated) 3 toys of one character, and 2 of another.  There weren't many people playing the carnival games that day, so we waited and waited for someone to walk up.  Well, it was something like a 5 year old and parents; we only had enough point\/tickets\/money left for one more game.  My fianc\u00e9 made me play as she didn't have the heart to beat a 5 year old.  Well, neither did I.  I pointed my gun to the side and let it squirt so the kid though I was going against him.  You should have seen his face light up and the parents get all excited, they even looked over and mouthed, \"thank you\" silently while celebrating with their son.\n\n\nWhile we were happy to walk away without all the toys we wanted, we realized we had done something much better.  Earlier the CM had gotten to know us while we waited for more people to play and we explained what we were doing.  When we got up to walk away after the last game, she gave the winner their toy, and tossed us another.\n\n\nIt just reminded me that guests at the park can be just as important at providing magic to park visitors as cast members.

I get excited to go to work and I can't wait for the following day to come in and make someone smile. I genuinely love Disneyland and working in an atmosphere surrounded by so many different people. \n\n\nOnto my venting: Let me start off by saying that I will do literally everything in my power to do back flips for guests if they show respect to me as a human being and also kindness. Today we had a family come to one of our shows. She was traveling in an ECV chair and we have guidelines in our building as to where they can be parked. Seeing that one of my fellow cast members was being chewed out by the woman, being the person I am I tried to swoop in and save the day. I tried to accommodate to the best of my ability. I tried to give her as close to the front as possible without breaking any of our safety rules and even offered to move her family to a better spot. In return I got screamed at to \"Get the F out of her face\". The first person I had the pleasure of speaking with at work and she treating me like garbage. \n\n\nPeople forget that although we work at the happiest place on earth; we are still human. We are given guidelines and rules to follow as any other job would. I understand that someone of those guidelines offset guests days. Some don't make sense. There is a reason for everything we do at the park. There is a reason rules and restrictions are set in place. Our number one goal above all else is safety. \n\n\nThe worst feeling in the world is being excited to do your job only to have someone make you feel like you're the size of an ant when you are showing kindness. Remember that cast members are people. We follow certain rules. We may not ALWAYS smile because we are dealing with a lot throughout the day. Guest compliments really help. But more importantly your patience and kindness means the absolute world to us. \n\n\nThank you to the majority of you that make my job a blessing instead of a burden.",

  "text":"Disneyland 2016 write up\n\n\nThought I would do a write up from our trip while it is still fresh in my mind. It was a great trip and I can't wait to back to a Disney Park.\n\n\nMonday May 30\n\n\nTravel day. I got off work at 7am, went home, showered and got the car packed up. Was pretty proud of how efficient we were at getting out the door. We often have trouble with this on trips so it was nice to get under way on a good note. A quick stop at McDonald's and getting to Disney music blasting and we were of to the airport, just a quick 2 hour drive.\n\n\nSecurity, customs and boarding went smoothly. The girls acted great in the airport and on the plane. I was happy that the change in altitude and air pressure didn't bother them too much! LAX was a bit overwhelming, but we managed to get through. Or car rental was the first real snag we came across in our trip. We were supposed to call this number and they would send a shuttle to pick us up and take us to the rental office. When I called they told us to take a cab instead. Frustrating. Especially when we see shuttles for all the other rental companies coming and going. Of to the taxi stand where we get to enjoy the challenge of getting car seats for one.... Grr.\n\n\nI was pretty upset and frustrated by the time we reached the rental office. Somehow I managed to calm down while waiting line. The irate and ride customers before me might have helped me try be nicer and calmer. It took longer to get the rental and get the car seats in and adjusted than I would have liked, but we finally got on the road. That was a bit terrifying. Took a wrong turn once, but managed to get the hotel OK. Here Maps didn't even take me on any bus only and backstage areas this time like it did in Orlando.\n\n\nThe Grand Legacy at the Park is nothing to write home about. I have no real complaints, but it wasn't super nice. One thing for sure: the crib they provided did not fit well in the room. We pretty much just dumped our luggage in the room and headed out as we were later getting there than we had planned. We had planned to head to Downtown Disney and do some shopping and grab supper. We decided not to let the late arrival ruin our plans and we headed out.\n\n\nAs soon as hit the bus loading zone and heard the music me and Natel got a little extra spring in our step. We also noticed that it smelled like Disney... not sure how that works as we've only been to Walt Disney World before. I decided it must in some pesticide they use. Possible laced with happy drugs. After picking up our tickets and buttons (Happily Ever After for me and Natel and First Time for Mara-Jade and Elara) we headed straight for Earl of Sandwich and enjoyed our later supper. Over supper we discussed our options and whether we wanted to try and use our Morning Magic the next day as we had planned and sacrifice more sleep. I should !mention that at this point I had been awake for over 30 hours between working the night before and then heading straight into travel mode. I do wish I could sleep better in vehicles. We decided to stick to the plan and instead cut our shopping down a bit. Mainly skipping Build a Bear and the Lego Store as well some others we might have wandered through if we had more time. By the time we finished supper it was already later than we had planned on being up. We hit Jazz Kitchen Express for some Beignets (amazing!) And then did some shopping at Pin Traders and World of Disney. We got Diamond Celebration pins for the girls, but I held off to look at other options. I did pick up my Made With Magic Diamond Celebration ears. Finally we headed back to the hotel with time for 5-6 hours of sleep.\n\n\nTuesday May 31\n\n\nYawn! Not much sleep, but we got up and going in decent time. Magic Morning hour meant being at the park for 7am. We made it and were able to knock out most of Fantasy land before 8! But not before we stopped for a few minutes near the Partners statue so Mara-Jade could look at and talk to the ducks waddling around. We rode Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, King Arthur's Carousel, Dumbo, Snow White's Scary Adventure, Casey Jr Circus Train, Pinocchio's Daring Adventure and The Mad Tea Party. I enjoyed riding so many original 1955 rides. Something about know that Walt had a hand in their creation and had actually ridden them made them special to me. When we stepped off Dumbo we ran to our first character of the trip. We walked out the exit and saw Peter Pan just sitting on the photo op Dumbo Car, staring off into space. This was our first experience with with Disneyland characters and we could tell they would be different from Disney world. We were the first ones to come across him and Mara-Jade didn't know what to think. The fact that he stared off away from her while she stood looking up at him didn't help. She ended up saying she didn't want to meet him so we headed off to Casey Jr. Meanwhile she had a mini meltdown because she DID in fact want to meet Peter Pan. Natel headed off to grab the autograph stuff while me and Mara-Jade had a little chat about changing her mind and having meltdowns. Then we got in line to see Peter. The interaction went great and Mara-Jade really enjoyed it. She was a little Leary about characters last year in Disney World so it was nice to see her deal with it well on the first character. THEN we headed to Casey Jr. While we were in line to ride it Captain Hook showed up. It was fun watching Peter hide from Hook and then get in behind and follow him around imitating him. We rode the circus train and I ended up sitting with a lady from Arizona. We chatted about Disney trips. When we got out a line had formed to meet Captain Hook so we went and joined it. Turns out it was for Hook and Pan we got to meet Pan twice. When Mara-Jade walked up to them Peter got a big smile on his face and welcomed his Friend back to him. Mara-Jade was pretty happy that she was Peter Pan's friend. Later we found The Mad Hatter and Alice by the tea cups. We managed to get in line just as he told the line the secret code we would need to meet them. Then we got to turn everyone else that came away if they didn't know the code. That was fun. We also hit the Mad Hatter store and picked up ears for Mara-Jade and Elara. Mara-Jade picked ones with a tiara and veil that says Princess on the front. We got Elara a pink one with Disneyland and Minnie mouse on it and got her name stitched in the back. By the time we had to head for breakfast we had knocked out all the attractions from fantasyland except for Story Book Canal Boats, Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan (it was broken).\n\n\nThen I ran and grabbed us Fast Passes for Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin and met up with the girls at Plaza Inn for breakfast with Minnie Mouse. The food was good, but certainly nothing special. It was similar to the Crystal Palace in WDW. In fact the whole thing reminded me of Crystal Palace, right down to the location on the park. We got to meet Chip and Dale, Max(!), Gepetto, Hook (again), Eyeore, Minnie, Pooh and Tigger. Felt like a great use of time! I always recommend character dining if you are wanting to meet people. It's nice to relax while you eat and have them come to you instead of waiting in long lines.\n\n\nAfter breakfast it was off to Toon Town. We saw Goofy doing a meet just outside Roger's Cartoon Spin, so we hopped in line. We were told that the line was closed and that he would be back later, or if we wanted to wait we could walk him out. After some confusion on the timing Mara-Jade was able to walk Goofy out hand in hand, skipping along before we headed back to use our cartoon spin fast pass. Then Mara-Jade had a blast exploring the Dog Pound and Goofy's play house. We went through Mickey's house and got to meet the big cheese himself. Minnie wasn't home but we checked out her place anyway. Donald's boat too. I convinced Mara-Jade to come on Gadget's Go Coaster with me. She didn't really know what to think of it. I saw some smiles and some horrified looks. Chip 'n Dale's treehouse, Pluto's Hotdogs and Daisy's Diner finished up Toon Town and signalled time for the girls to head for nap time.\n\n\nThe first item on my big boys ride list was The Matterhorn. It's the only one that doesn't have a counterpart that I had already rode in Walt Disney World. That's where I headed first. Crazy long line reaching almost all the way around the mountain. I wish I understood how the single rider line worked because I don't think I really needed to wait in line. But it was OK. I read a book and texted mom. The Coaster was lots of fun. I can never stop smiling and giggling on roller coasters. I love them. After getting off The Matterhorn, I spotted Space Mountain in the distance, or rather, Hyperspace Mountain. Being the Star Wars fan I am this seemed like a good spot to head next. 75 minute wait time... mostly outside in the heat. I think this is where I got my sun burn. I passed the time in line mostly by eaves dropping. Watching people play Heads Up is lots of fun. Then the three people behind me started working on a riddle. I ended up joining them and having fun working on the riddle. That passed a good chunk of time and I made some friends. Albeit friends I will never see again. Hyperspace Mountain was amazing! It felt similar to Space Mountain in WDW, but the Star Wars overlay was really fun and seemed well done to me. I've heard some people talking shot how they are done with Seasons of the Force (and The Diamond Celebration) and they want things to go back to normal. I'm glad that they stuck around!\n\n\nI wandered past Star Tours but it had a long line and I did ride it about 100 times on my trips to WDW. It would been nice to see the new Force Awakens scenes, but... time. I headed through Adventure Land hoping to pick up a Dole Whip, but... lines... I continued on and thought about getting a Monte Crisco at Cafe Orleans, but it was a 20 minute wait just to sit down. I wanted more rides! So I headed to Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.\n\n\nMade more friends in another long line. Also saw a cute turtle basking in the sun. Overall Big Thunder Mountain felt similar to WDW's iteration of it. Which means, of course, that i enjoyed it greatly. I also enjoyed the glimpses of work being done on what will become Star Wars land (possibly with a better name than that) that you can see from parts of the ride. By the time I was finished the girls were awake and getting ready to come rejoin me so I started hearing in the direction of the gates.\n\n\nBut I had to stop at the Dole Factory for my Dole Whip Float. Line was still looking, but worth it. This time I made friends with a Pokemon loving girl and we discussed our inability to keep comments to ourselves when it comes to certain subjects. At the front of the line I got my sweet delicious Dole Whip. Then I wandered up Main Street and found the Hook & Ladder Co. Band playing in front of the Fire Dept. I stood and watched them until they finished up, then I just stood around, looking up at the light in Walt's apartment. Unfortunately Natel had not gotten my message that I would be by the Fire Dept so she had walking up and down Main Street searching for me. Oops!\n\n\nOnce reunited (with a very fresh, happy and energized Mara-Jade) we finished off Fantasyland with Alice in Wonderland, Storybook canal boats and it's a Small World (although I don't know if it's technically part of Fantasyland). By the time we got done on Small World crowds were gathering for Paint the Night. We grabbed food at Village Haus Restaurant and scoped out a spot to watch the parade. It was more challenging than we would have liked to find a spot. People really do park early for these things! We ended up back near small world and had a spot a few rows of people back, but still unobstructed views.\n\n\nIf I had to pick a favourite moment from this trip, it would come during Paint the Night. The music already had me jacked up. When can we do this again?!?!! We were all watching with smiles on our faces (well, except for Elara... I was holding her and while she wasn't happy, she wasn't upset. Just oblivious.). Natel was holding Mara-Jade so she could see better. Nothing at the beginning of the parade was really jumping out at Mara-Jade and I was starting to fear she wasn't enjoying it. Then Ariel's float came into view. Mara-Jade turned to me with the most excited look on her face. I don't know if I've seen her so happy. \"Daddy! it's Ariel!!! And her daddy!\" The look of happiness and joy melted me. I had tears in my eyes for the rest of the parade. This enthusiasm built as more character\u2019s floats came out. Jesse! Woody! Buzz! Belle! Each time a character she recognized (pretty much all of them) she would shout in happiness. Anna and Elsa came out and she got even MORE excited. So much fun. That fifteen minute parade and the happiness it brought our little girl made the whole trip, and all the money we spent on it worth it. After all, \"all magic comes at price deary.\"\n\n\nWhen the parade ended we jumped in the wave of people following along behind it to try and get a good view for the fireworks. As seems to be our tradition, we did not. 2009 wishes - behind a tree. 2015 Illuminations - good seats, but obstructed by the patio roof. 2015 wishes - Ummm... behind multiple trees, from a bad angle somewhere near the river, but the accompanying Dole Whip was delicious. 2016 Disneyland Forever? Behind a tree. It's not like any of these circumstances ruined the experience, just not optimal viewing. I really liked the use if The Matterhorn for projections in this show. The castle had projections too, we just couldn't see them well.\n\n\nAfter the fireworks ended we headed around the Castle back to fantasyland to truly finish it as we still hadn't rode Peter Pan which had come back at some point in the day. We got there to find the area roped off and a huge sea of people waiting. So we waited with them. Eventually the rope was dropped, but not before a line of people filed out of Mr. Toad's Wild Ride and into the que for Peter Pan. I'm still not sure how that worked at all. Once the rope dropped we all made our way into the que as well. I didn't time it, but this was a long line. It said 15 minutes when we entered. It was longer. I spotted a guy wearing a STAR Laboratories shirt, so on one of our passes, I said, \"Hey, STAR Labs... you guys really need to up your security!\" He laughed and said he'd get on it and tell the speed force. Each time we passed each other we shared a smile. We were in line behind a lady who was a bit personal... she talked a lot and took subjects further than I think strangers should. Lol that's OK though. Natel also answered some questions about our baby wrap to someone we kept passing in line. Eventually we got to the front of the line and were able to ride it. I think Natel was a bit disappointed. She said she remembered it being better on her childhood trip. What\u2019s funny is that it recently went through a revision that improved a lot of effects in it. It was about what I expected it to be. Quite similar to WDW. Then it was back to the hotel to end the first day in the parks.\n\n\nWednesday June 1\n\n\nDisney California Adventure. This is a pretty cool park. It's really all over the place, but that is kinda nice. We got a late start because we somehow got our wires crossed on what time it opened, so we missed rope drop and probably about an hour of the morning. When we arrived I grabbed a fast pass for Radiator Spring Racers and then we headed to grab fast passes for World of Color. The first actual attraction on our list was Midway Mania so we made our way to Paradise Pier and got in the long line (have you noticed all the long lines? Most things we rode had long lines, except for all of fantasyland during the Magic Morning). Mara-Jade made some friends in this line, but that largely just got her in trouble as they all wanted to hang off the chains and climb on the railings. Overall she was really good. When we got on the ride Mara-Jade decided to ride with Natel so I went alone. Even though Natel was struggling not to squish Elara and keep Mara-Jade from sliding all over the place, she still got a higher score than me. I'm never very good at Midway Mania for some reason. In the gift shop at the end Mara-Jade spotted a set of Toy Story figurines with a bunch of characters from the movie that are about the same size as some other Disney figurines she has. She decided she wanted them, but the remainder of her spending money was reserved for a Star Wars shirt she was determined she could find at Disneyland. We talked to her about the decision and that she could buy the toys if she wanted, but she would be out of spending money then, and couldn't get a shirt. She thought about it and decided on the toys. I think it was a good decision since we can find a shirt at home AND she would grow out of it shortly whereas she can play with the figures for at least a good few years. Even better, now she had a bad guy for me to play as when I played with her the rest of the trip. Next Mara-Jade and I did King Triton's Carousel and then we all did Mickey's Fun Wheel (non swinging). Somewhere in here we got in line to meet Jesse, but the time we got to her she was trading with Woody. She ended up giving Mara-Jade a nice, big hug on her way out, but we missed out on her autograph. By the time we got off of the Fun Wheel it was time I could get another fast pass. California Screamin' had been down most of the morning, but I figured I could still grab a fast pass for it, so I left the girls who were planning on checking out a nearby shop and I headed to ride it. Before I left I had the thought that if it re opens just as I get there, there won't be a line so I checked to make sure Natel did not mind if I hopped on if there wasn't a line. She said that would work so I headed off. Low and behold, as I walked up it reopened and I was able to ride the second car that came through. It was awesome. Possibly as fun as Rockin' at Hollywood Studios. The dark is fun there, but the beauty of the Pier racing past you is really nice. I got back to the girls just as Elara finished eating and we proceeded to the nearby shop. Then Mara-Jade and I rode the Golden Zephyr. Next was some photos across from the fun wheel and then Under the Sea. By this time it was time for lunch at Ariel's Grotto. I think I went and got a fast pass for Tower of Terror first.\n\n\nAriel's Grotto was nice. First we met Ariel as we entered. The line moved pretty slowly, but at least she did autographs. At our Jedi Mickey and Friends Supper at SWW2015 the photo with Jedi Mickey was really quick and he didn't sign. After meeting with Ariel (Mara-Jade and her had a fairly lengthy discussion that Mara-Jade won't tell me about) we were seated. We sat outside, across the bay from the California Screamin' take off location. We were also the first table the rest of the Princesses came to visit, and we were right beside where they came out. This resulted in Mara-Jade being excited quite often! I enjoyed how they did the character visits. At other one's I've been to the characters came at seemingly random times, but here they have an announcer that introduces the Princess and then she comes out greets the room, then proceeds to the first table (us!). I think maybe as they make thier way around and spend different amounts of time at different tables they probably get spread out more than they were for us. I liked how quickly we got to see them all. It was only about 5 minutes between each Princess being introduced so I think that we had met all 4 before our food came. Speaking of food, it was good. I got a Beef Tri Tip with Asparagus and Mashed Potatoes. Yummy. I just wish there was more of it. Also, as expected with Character Dining, the price was much more than the food was worth. It's the experience. AND not needing to wait in line to see these five princesses! I took off from lunch before dessert was served so I could hit my fast pass on Radiator Springs Racers, but when I got there it was closed. I checked with a cast member to make sure my Fast Pass would still be good later on and then I headed to the Tower of Terror since I was within my Fast Pass return time for it now.\n\n\nTower of Terror was mostly as I remember it, right down to the exact same pre-show. But that's OK, because it's good. I wouldn't mind if one of the coasts got the rumored Guardians of the Galaxy overlay, but I hope they keep at least one of them mostly as is. My vote would be for DisneyLand to get the Marvel make over because it\u2019s common to see Marvel stuff at DisneyLand. That felt odd to me, since Universal has the rights to most of the Marvel Properties east of the Mississippi (I think that\u2019s how it works). It was nice to see them, but it still felt out of place. Anyway\u2026 onto the ride. It felt to me like the drops were more intense than WDW. Then again at WDW they are randomized so you don\u2019t get the exact same experience each time. I wonder if the fact that it\u2019s a set course means they were able to dial in the intensity. Better views when the doors open up too. It faces DisneyLand Park so you can see Space Mountain and the Matterhorn clearly. Oh, and our bell hop that was operating our elevator was cool. He was large and mostly acted very stern, going and dealing with unruly guests in halls and staring people down, but a few times he would crack and you could see just how much  he was enjoying himself. Made me want to work at Disney (not the first time I\u2019ve wanted that\u2026 even convinced the Warden at Fort Wilderness to make me his deputy). WDW\u2019s Tower of Terror has the better ride intro. The long hall your elevator car travels through is much better there. After this I headed back to Radiator Springs Racer.\n\n\nCars Land is gorgeous, let me just say that. Radiator Springs Racer had re-opened and I was able ride it. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because it was closed earlier and they were honoring missed Fast Passes, but the Fast Pass line was crazy long. I feel like it was probably 30-45 minutes. I didn\u2019t time it though. The ride was great. It\u2019s pretty much a beautifully themed Test Track, but the fast part has more curves and some fun little hills. Really, it\u2019s better than Test Track in every way, but that\u2019s about the only thing I can compare it to. Also, my car lost the race. And I almost lost a pin. Car seat belts always seem to pop a pin off my lanyard. I lost a pin when I wore my lanyard to see The Force Awakens because of that. My afternoon got a little weird after this because I didn\u2019t know what was going on with the girls. Mara-Jade took forever to fall asleep so nap time stretched and I wasn\u2019t sure when they\u2019d be back. I decided to go do California Screamin\u2019 again since it was so fun. Struck up a conversation with a guy and his mom in line right behind me, and shortly after a couple friends of his show up and chat with them. I didn\u2019t listen too closely to their conversation but I heard something about Single Rider line so after they left I asked if they knew where the single rider line was, they said no, but asked if I was a single rider. Turns out the friends were looking to give one fastpass away to a single rider since the cast member running the Fast Pass line had only taken one of theirs so they had a spare valid one. The guy ended up running after them to get me the pass! By the time he had caught up ot them and got back his mom and me were way ahead in the line and staying behind to wait for him. I thanked them when he returned and hopped out of line to hit the Fast Pass! SWEET! This time I waited for the Front seats. Good times! When I was done, it felt like I should go again so I asked about the single rider line and went in there. It really isn\u2019t that fast moving, but surely better than the standby line! I was HOT when I was done so I thought cooling down on Grizzly River Rapids would be nice. But I got over there and found it was closed. I decided to wait around the area, checking out shops and hope that it re-opened. No such luck. Eventually I wandered over and decided to ride Soarin\u2019 Over California. It\u2019s the exact same ride as at Epcot, but it felt a bit more special since it ends at DisneyLand and I was there. Plus I knew it would be my last chance to see it as it\u2019s (rumored at least) to be getting replaced by a new Soarin\u2019 Around the World in the next few weeks. And, hey, it didn\u2019t hurt that it was inside and A\/C\u2019d! The single rider line seemed awesome and just as fast as the Fast Pass line to me, but I think I might have just gotten lucky because I have since heard that single rider\u2019s can often wait a very long time before the theatre has that one extra seat not filled. Either way, I enjoyed it until I got outside in the heat and immediately noticed I didn\u2019t have my hat! I made the embarrassing journey back, against the flow of people with a seven year old kid getting berated by his father for forgetting HIS hat\u2026 That felt great\u2026 But at least our hats were still there! In 2012 I lost my R2-D2 Mickey Mouse Ears hat on Star Tours and never did find it. But the good cast members there got me a new one from Tatooine Traders.\n\n\nWith Grizzly River Run still not open, I was at a bit of a loss with what to do next. I found out Mara-Jade had finally gone to sleep and Natel would let her nap until 5. It was just after 4 at the time so I thought heading to Disneyland to either ride Splash Mountain or Star Tours would take too long (I also kind of wanted to head over for more Dole Whip!). Since I thought I didn\u2019t have time I wandered DCA some more. I chatted with a guy at a Disney Vacation Club booth about the costs and benefits of the club, and got a pretty sweet pin for playing his game. It was after 5 now and I expected the girls back soon, but a text from Natel said she would wake Mara-Jade up at 6\u2026 I guess she had hit the wrong number in the text that said 5. I was kinda bummed about that because if I had known it was 6 at the first text I would have headed to Disneyland for a bit. I mostly just wandered around some more and then headed to our meeting spot, Dot\u2019s Spray Puddle. When the girls showed up Mara-Jade had a BLAST here. She really loves spray parks.\n\n\nAfter getting Mara-Jade dried and dressed (and assuring her the puddle on the floor of the bathroom stall from her swim suit would dry) we went on Heimlich\u2019s Chew Chew Train (it was meh in my opinion, super short, I\u2019m not sure if Mara-Jade enjoyed it or not), Francis\u2019 Ladybug Boogie (a tamer version of the Tea Cups, but enjoyable) and Tuck and Roll\u2019s Drive \u2018Em Buggies (where Mara-Jade was thrilled that I let her drive). It was getting late by this time so we headed to Flo\u2019s V8 cafe for supper. It wasn\u2019t the greatest choice, because although it is quick service and the food was decent, they use real dishes and we had planned to take our food to the viewing area for World of Color. We ended up eating fast and trying to force Mara-Jade to do the same so we could get a decent spot (even with Fast Passes we knew the area would be packed). We were right, but we managed to get a spot at the front of our viewing area. On the way over we stopped at the same wash rooms Mara-jade had changed in earlier. She noticed the puddle was gone and made a point of telling me I was right. I thought with the fast passes for World of Color we would be in a seated area, but there were no seats to be found there. It looks like you need to do a dessert party type thing to get seats. Oh well.\n\n\nI think World of Color might be my new favorite night time show. It\u2019s hosted by Neil Patrick Harris and talks a lot about Walt and his vision and dreams. These parts really aren\u2019t that great for kids and I could see Mara-Jade\u2019s interest waning, but ultimately she enjoyed it too. She sang along with Let it Go and pointed out to me when there were Star Wars clips. The park was closed when the show was over so we headed out with everyone else (except for the Grad Nite celebrators). We have wanted Mickey\u2019s Kitchen Sinks since seeing them before our trip last year to WDW so we decided to stop in at Clarabelle\u2019s Hand Scooped Ice Cream to get some. That was a lot of ice cream for 9:30 pm. Neither of us finished the ice cream, even with Mara-Jade helping us. It was more about getting the bowls. We still need two more! Then it was back to the hotel to prep for the next day and get some ZZZzzzz\u2019s.\n\n\nThursday June 2\n\n\nHappy Anniversary to my gorgeous wife!\n\n\nAnd also, happy Frozen day! The Friday before our trip started a new Frozen Musical opened up at the Hyperion Theatre. So my mission upon entering the park was to grab us fast pass tickets to get in to see it. Quite simply, less than a week after the show opened, if you don\u2019t have a fast pass, you don\u2019t get in. We got to DCA before rope drop and I grabbed all our park tickets and headed over to the throngs of people lined up and waiting to get fast passes. The crowds were insane. We were packed into a section of the street and then when the rope was dropped we were slowly herded into single file and finally into a TAPE MAZE in a large open area. They had simply put tape down in a maze pattern and we dutifully wandered through it. Eventually I got our fast passes and went and met up with the Girls to go meet Anna and Elsa. I did mention it was Frozen day, right? I was happy that there weren\u2019t long lines for this. We were in and out quickly and Mara-Jade seemed to enjoy the meet much more this year than last year. I think we had built it up a bit too much last year and I was disappointed she wasn\u2019t more excited to see them. She was happier this time so I felt better. Lol After meeting them we decided to do the other attractions in Animation Academy which included Turtle Talk with Crush (I really enjoyed it, but I don\u2019t think Mara-Jade quite knew what to think about talking to a turtle\u2026) and The Sorcerer's Workshop (meh\u2026 it was half closed and I didn\u2019t really understand the purpose). Then we continued Frozen Day by heading over to the backlot where Olaf does meets, but he was nowhere to be seen. Instead we met Doc McStuffins, rode Mike and Sully to the Rescue (I was really disappointed in the animatronics here, they seemed well done in all but the NON MOVING MOUTH. I guess I have just come to expect Disney Audio Animatronics to be better, especially when the rest of them (and the whole ride) looked so good! Right at the end Roz showed up and says things specific to those in the car. She said something about my big ears. And she looked fantastic, complete with moving mouth while she talked! This just showed they CAN do it, so I wish they had on the rest of the ride too.) Then we met Sofia the First and got in line for Olaf who would be coming out soon. The Cast members handling this line were fun and had us cheering and chanting at random people. Olaf came out and we met him, got photo\u2019s and his \u2018autograph\u2019. Then we headed for Disney Junior Live on Stage. Mara-Jade had REALLY enjoyed this show in WDW last year so I was looking forward to it. She did not disappoint as she danced and sang, popped bubbles, spun in the snow and collected gold doubloons. Then we headed for the Hyperion to see Frozen, but spotted Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde doing a meet and greet on the way so we hopped (haha) in line to meet them. When we were done the line to get into the Hyperion was really really long, stretching halfway back down Hollywood Blvd (I might have made that street name up). It was a long, hot wait, and Mara-Jade was bored for it. But she enjoyed the show, so that made up for it. Me? I miss Aladdin live at the Hyperion. Did I ever see it? Nope, but I still miss it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the Frozen show here is good. High production value, great actors, and cool effects, but the clips I\u2019ve seen of Aladdin look like so much fun. The Genie looked so funny! And I feel that he would bring a good bit of re-watch value to the show as he made topical jokes (just like the Genie in the movies) about current events. With the Frozen show\u2026 I don\u2019t have much interest in seeing it again on our next trip. I\u2019m sure I WILL see it again on our next trip, but I don\u2019t have much interest in doing so. Haha\n\n\nWith our Frozen Festivities complete we headed to the Pacific Wharf to get some lunch. Natel was clamoring for some Clam Chowder at Pacific Wharf Cafe. I got a Apple Walnut Salad that was surprisingly delicious and THEN I ATE THE BOWL! (they were served in a bread bowl) I was disappointed to wait in line at Rita\u2019s Baja Blenders to find that they didn\u2019t have Strawberry Margaritas. :( This was the first of a series of disappointments on a hot afternoon. We decided to head over to Disneyland and try to finish up a few things there. On the list was meeting Snow White (Mara-Jade had been asking), meeting Jasmine (Natel has been wanting to meet her since she was 7 and her mom wouldn\u2019t let her), get some Dole Whip, Ride Pirates, Indiana Jones, Jungle Cruise and get Elara a personalized parasole. \n\n\nWe found Snow White between the Gates and the Tunnel, but the line was cut off before we got in it. So we headed to Adventureland to find a long line at Dole Whip (pass) and Aladdin, Jasmine and Genie doing a greet at Aladdin\u2019s Oasis! AWESOME!! But, the line once again closed before we got there and there would be no more greets for the day. Since it\u2019s our last day this means a fifth trip for Natel without meeting Jasmine. SO CLOSE TOO! :( The Jungle Cruise was closed. Indiana Jones had too long of a line for something we would need to do twice, so we continued on to Pirates of the Caribbean. Long line here too, but at least we could all go! In we went, I enjoyed going on the original ride and the bit where we go down the waterfall and end up underwater were cool. Yo ho, Yo ho, a Pirate\u2019s life for me! We wants the red head!\n\n\nAfter pirates we searched New Orlean\u2019s Square until we found the parasole cart, but they didn\u2019t have the right size AND we couldn\u2019t pick it up until 9pm, which was after we had planned on being back at the hotel to pack up, so we passed (but upon looking at Mara-Jade\u2019s I think they WERE the right size). We continued on to Critter Country and found some ear\u2019s for Javan. Me and Mara-Jade went and rode Winnie the Pooh while Elara and Natel hung out at Hungry Bear. I passed on the food I had wanted from Hungry Bear since I was just too hot to feel like eating. I looked at Splash Mountain, but with an 80 minute line I chose not to make the girls wait. At some point we were able to get on Jungle Cruise! We had a good skipper and the ride was enhanced by three guests seated across from us who alternated between just Roaring at the jokes and admitting to only getting the puns 30 seconds later. And if you don\u2019t believe that, well then, you\u2019re in... We headed back to the hub and ended up finding the Royal Hall where one Snow White happened to be meeting! Another long line, but we got to meet Snow White which I thought would please Mara-Jade, and it did\u2026 until she remembered she hadn\u2019t met Sleeping Beauty yet\u2026 Oh well! We headed for supper at Galactic Grill (poor choice, really) and then headed back to the Hotel to get packed up and get some sleep for the 3:30am departure planned to make to back to the car rental and airport.\n\n\nI think I will spare the details of the travel home as they were pretty uneventful. We made it home and have started thinking and planning for our next trip. Sometime in the future. Hopefully. Until then, we will look back at the fond memories of past trips.\n\n\nAhhh, Disney.\n\n\nWalt Disney World vs. DisneyLand\n\n\nIt\u2019s both hard to compare these two resorts and hard NOT to. I\u2019ve been to WDW 3 times and this was my first trip to DLR. The most obvious difference in the sheer size and scope. WDW is HUGE! It\u2019s got 4 Parks plus 2 water parks compared to DLR\u2019s 2 parks. Disneyland can fit inside Magic Kingdon\u2019s parking lot (and I hear it would still have room for 500 cars alongside it!) But this goes both ways, on one hand WDW offers more to see and do, but it also takes longer to navigate from place to place. Last year we tried to do naps at WDW. It just wasn\u2019t feasible with all the buses required. A 2-3 hour nap becomes a 5 hour endeavor. The only time I feel naps might be possible at WDW is if you were staying at a resort on the monorail loop and only visiting the Magic Kingdom. Then it\u2019s just a quick monorail ride to your hotel. Other wise you have probably at least two bus rides to deal with, plus waiting for them to show up. There are many experiences at WDW that I missed by not being there. Plus the pure isolation from the real world\u2026 At DLR I was constantly hearing sirens from the real world, and right at the gate there were beggars and panhandlers every night. Plus right across the street people hocking their wares. You don\u2019t see that at WDW because Disney owns all the land. Another interesting tidbit is that WDW offers value accommodations. I think when we were looking for hotels at DLR the cheapest option from Disney was $350 a night. WDW has resorts from around $150 and camping from $59 a night. Both have nearby hotels. At DLR we stayed right across the street from the gates and paid less than even the WDW Value resorts, but staying with Disney on property has advantages (although it seems more so at WDW than DLR). WDW also has nearby hotels (although they are still a long way from the actual parks, not walking distance). You need to either have a car and be will to pay parking at the parks or rely on whatever transportation your hotel offers. We lucked out when we stayed off property in 2012 and our resort had really good busses that looped often to each park. I think at the hotel around the corner that Bryce and Amber stayed at they only had one bus a day to each park, so if you missed it\u2026 I think I see DLR becoming our \u2018home\u2019 park because of the fact we can do the trip for way cheaper than WDW and the ease of getting the girls over for nap time. I love both resorts and both have different advantages and disadvantages.",

I don't have a specific proposal for number of visits, but there could be various packages based on number of days available, the days of the week or season the passes could be used, and whether or not you could park-hop. \n\n\nSome examples: \n\n\n15 visit pass (no block out days, park hopper) - $800\n15 visit pass (weekdays only, park hopper) - $600\n\n\n20 visit pass (no block out days, single park) - $600\n20 visit pass (weekdays only, single park) - $400\n\n\nThe costs and packages could be figured out. The important thing is that I think this will somewhat reduce crowding, lessen the parking problem, and potentially increase per visit in-park spending, as people will most likely spend more time in the park on each visit. \n\n\nYour thoughts?",

  "title":"Thank you r\/Disneyland for all of your advice - my first trip was beyond magical! [Trip Review 6\/10\/16]",
  "text":"A few days ago, I asked about \ncommon mistakes made by first time visitors and how to avoid them\n. This sub has earned my respect and admiration for the unbelievable outpouring of advice that ultimately made my very first visit to Disneyland one that was not only efficient and productive, but also SO FREAKING FUN!!! We were able to go on lots of rides, meet Mickey, eat ourselves silly, take tons of photos, and enjoy all the magic along the way. Here is my full recap:\n\n\nAs per the advice of almost everyone, we left around 6 am to make it to the park by 7:30. Our timing could not have been better: we parked, got on the tram, got through security, and made it into the park right at 8 am on the dot. I went to City Hall to get my first visit button and I humble bragged for my friends [they are a recently married couple] so we all got to sport fancy pins.\n\n\nWe arrived at Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters and walked right into the ride [one of our collective favorites] with no line, which was a great way to kick off our day. We decided to wait it out at Hyperspace Mountain since we were already so close and the line was not very long at all. \n\n\nMy friend really wanted to ride the bobsleds at Matterhorn so we got in line. There were a bunch of technical difficulties and the line's wait kept getting longer and longer [first a 25 minute delay, then another 30 minute delay, etc] but we ultimately stuck it out. My friend's husband [and good sport] waited in line while we made a quick coffee run...with a brief detour at the Mad Tea Party while the line was practically non existent. This iconic ride was one of our favorite photo ops of the day, because who can resist cracking a genuine smile while spinning around in a purple teacup? Answer: not me. \n\n\nAfter bringing back coffee + snacks to our spot in line, the family in front of us started chatting with the Cast Member at the turnstile. I wanted so badly to jump in the convo because she was full of useful information. One of her facts that I thought was clever was that you can always tell what land you're in by the trash cans, because they are different in every land. She was a really sweet lady and I wish I remembered her name because she handled the crowd very well. \n\n\nWe followed the bobsleds with Peter Pan\u2019s Flight. While waiting in line, my friend was inspired by the Bippity Boppity Boutique and decided to fishtail braid my hair. I think we entertained the guests waiting around us because I would have to walk with the moving line while she was still working on the braid. I might not have gotten the princess treatment at BBB, but this came pretty close. This was one of my favorite rides because as cheesy as it sounds, I really did feel like I was flying over the rooftops. \n\n\nAfter that, the five minute wait at It's A Small World made our next decision pretty easy. While not the most thrilling of rides for our group of 20 somethings, it was fun to observe the little details and nuances of the display. Walking back towards Main Street, we stopped for a photo op in front of the castle, and thanks to another stellar piece of advice, I made sure we took our picture slightly to the side by the wishing well and we had almost no trouble getting a clear, photobomber-free shot! A true golden tip right there.\n\n\nSeeing as we were already at the castle, we saw the preparation for the marching band and decided to stick around. One of the cast members [I think his name was Steve] noticed my first visit button and said he might get some of the characters to come dance with me. It didn't happen, but it was still such an exciting thing to be recognized as someone experiencing all this magic for the first time! \n\n\nMy only other Disney park experience was at Disneyworld probably 15+ years ago, and the most vivid memory I have was riding Pirates of the Caribbean. I pointed out the Blue Bayou seating to my friends [again, thanks to advice from this sub], which seemed like a beautiful & serene place to dine, and went on to thoroughly enjoy the ride. The attention to detail and overall dynamic is 150% present in a ride like Pirates, and I loved it. \n\n\nLunch was next, and based on another stellar suggestion, I led our group to Bengal BBQ. My friend put it best, \"this place is hidden out of the way for a reason.\" It was rather delicious and quick to eat. The cast member at the register noticed my first visit button and we chatted about it. The most exciting part of eating\/hanging around this area, though, was I WATCHED SOMEONE GO INTO CLUB 33!!! I've known about Club 33 and its exclusivity for years, just as a general bit of trivia, so to see someone ring the doorbell, flash an ID, and get welcomed into such an exclusive part of Disneyland was rather exciting.\n\n\nWe walked around and did some window shopping. My friend's husband grabbed us Fast Passes for Indiana Jones and we split a 3 pack of the beignets. It only felt appropriate to eat at least one Mickey-shaped food during the day. We had lots of time to kill, so we ventured into the Haunted Mansion and then kept walking around. \n\n\nAnother memory I have from my trip [over a decade ago] to Disneyworld is my mom getting me a customized parasol, a gorgeous magenta umbrella with my name written on it surrounded by flowers. I loved that thing to death and I wish I still had it...lo & behold, I walked right by the parasol kiosk. It was hard to resist purchasing, but thankfully I decided it was a nostalgic indulgence that I could afford to miss out on this time around. Such a beautiful and sentimental moment!\n\n\nOur previously attained Fast Passes for the Indiana Jones ride were definitely one of the best decisions of the day. We breezed through the line for one of the most exhilarating rides of the day. I convinced my friends to follow this with the Jungle Cruise, and our skipper was HILARIOUS. Our boat\u2019s skipper, Juan, was so spirited and really made the ride special. As we left the boat, I told him he was Juan in a million.\n\n\nBased on yet another tip from this sub, I sought out the second line for the Dole Whip stand. It was sadly not any shorter than the main line, but I decided the shaded area in the Enchanted Tiki line was the better option. My friends went in & out of the Tiki Room show before I had even gotten to the stand. I have no idea why this was the slowest moving line I had been in all day but god damn, was it worth it. As someone who loves pineapple juice, creamy desserts, and is lactose intolerant, the float is pretty much perfection in a cup and I want one right friggin now.\n\n\nNext, we headed to Toontown. The level of detail is of course up to Disney standard, but I was astounded by the cartoon mountains in the background. That really took it over the top and I loved it. We walked through some of the character houses and it was one of those moments when you felt like these characters were real, actual people who maintained gardens and checked their voicemail and put up doggy fences and had a movie barn [of course], instead of simple drawings & voices. We caught a super short line to meet Mickey and watching a small toddler light up with joy at the site of her favorite character might have been the most heartwarming thing ever.\n\n\nAlthough we planned on being there as long as possible, at this point, we had pretty much exhausted our second wind and were dragging ourselves across the park. After a bit of shopping on Main Street for our family & friends, our final ride of the day was the Finding Nemo submarine ride. I adore Finding Nemo and the concept of this ride was pretty well done. Our seats in the sub faced the wall of the tank, so it kind of felt like the other side had a better view, but watching a projected Dory flutter by and speak whale made it all worth it. \n\n\nWe hopped on the tram back to the parking lot and caught the most exquisite sunset I\u2019ve seen since moving to LA. It really could not have been a more perfect ending to our first Disneyland experience. An annual pass is probably not in my near future, but hopefully a few more visits to the park [including California Adventure] will be! Again, a huge thanks to this sub for all of the invaluable advice, it truly made our day infinitely better than if we had walked in and just winged it. I can\u2019t wait to go back!",

Please do not mistake this for that.\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I are heading to Disneyland this November\/December and it's just something that has been at the back of my mind (even more so given what happened in Florida). I'm from Canada, and while I grew up going, he has never been and really wants this trip to be something we can share together, but I'm nervous. He hasn't been to the states many times in general.\n\n\nIs Disneyland a safe place for us? I'm not asking for any special accommodations or anything, but would we be okay simply holding hands? Will people react poorly if they see two men who are obviously a couple? I really want to make this trip special, I truly do. Disneyland holds a lot of important memories for me, and I've dreamed of sharing it with someone I love, but his safety will always be more important to me and I will do anything to protect him, even if I have to cancel a dream vacation. \n\n\nEDIT: I didn't have time this morning to reply to each and every one of you, but I just wanted to say thank you so much.

However, I got wait listed for QSR primarily and Attractions second. \n\n\nAttractions is the position that I am really interested in though. I am wondering if I do not take the position in QSR if there's till a chance to get an offer for attractions? Or if I reject QSR will I be forgotten about for attractions? Thanks guys!",

  "text":"(on crappy mobile internet atm, can't find a vid just yet)\n\n\nI've been listening to the Disneyland 50th Anniversary soundtrack pretty much on repeat for a week or two now, and there's one thought I can't get out of my head--the Carousel of Progress sounds like something out of a dystopian nightmare to me. \n\n\nSure, it's happy, and optimistic, and cheerful--but maybe a little bit \ntoo\n much so, at least for my tastes. The Carousel sets up this world in which sponsor General Electric is becoming increasingly involved in everyone's lives, and the message is \"Isn't that wornderful, kids??\" \n\n\nFurther, I feel that if you were to replace the word \"Progress\" in the narration with literally any other word, it would work equally well--if not be a little creepier: \"Anytime we think we've gone just about as far as we can, there's a new springtime of [ FACISM \/ ALIENS \/ THE GREAT MACHINE \/ CTHULHU].\"\n\n\nBut the line that gets me every time comes after the dog barks at the audience for the third or fourth time: \"Cut that out, buster! They might be a good customer of General Electric!\" \n\n\nI'm sure it's meant for humor, but, taken out of context, it seems to be saying that the only thing that makes you worth protecting is not safety, not comfort, not simple human decency--it's whether you choose to consume the \"correct\" brand of appliances.\n\n\nI'm \npositive\n this isn't how it was meant--but I still find it deeply amusing to picture this same sort of show in, say, the city of Rapture from the Bioshock games, and how little would have to actually change.",

My brother found a job and already has approval for the time off work. I have reached my minimum budget and am nearly at my \"dream\" budget as far as money I've saved. My parents know, my brother and his wife know, the kids will not know until the day before (roughly, haven't quite planned that out yet).\nAnyway, so my parents are getting up there in age. Mid\/late 60's. They aren't as mobile as they use to be. They recently visited me in Vegas and when walking with them it was at a snail's pace, and they really can't walk long distances without needing to sit down for a break. Obviously this is a problem as you have to cover a lot of ground in the park.\nHowever, they are being stubborn. I brought up getting them some wheel chairs so we could push them around the park and save them the pain and us the time. However, their response was \"nahhhh, we'll be fine\".\nHas anyone faced this scenario and found a way to convince someone? My first try was a very casual and light hearted attempt. But I need this to happen. I really feel like they will hold the entire group back and limit our activities throughout the day.\nI just don't know how to say that to them without hurting their feelings ya know?\nI was considering renting one wheelchair, and push it empty as bait for one of them to jump in, and hope the other would follow suit.\nOr should I just go full adult and say \"this is how it is, deal with it\" ?\nUgh, it's really tough because at this point, my parents haven't really had to face their aging bodies and I feel like I'm smacking them with reality. I'm not sure I want to see their faces in that moment.\nI dunno, any advice is appreciated.",

We are WDW veterans and know that DL is not nearly as cutthroat about ADRs as the world can be. With that being said maybe we're just jumping the gun but we do know we want to make several ADRs at both DL and DCA. Currently, the online reservation system allows for DCA reservations up until September 8th which is 60 days out but DL is not showing availability for diner at any location, only lunches. DL seems to operate a bit different than WDW and the park hours and calendar isn't even available yet, do you think this has something to do with it? \n\n\nFor example we want to have dinner at Blue Bayou on our first day the 6th, it shows no tables as being available for dinner from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM but if you look just one day prior on the 5th you can select a time. It is well past 60 days so I would have thought you could make a res. I am worried that maybe this has something to do with the Diamond Days 60th celebration coming to a close then. Does anyone have any ideas as to why that is happen? \n\n\nI know I am probably just being a little paranoid considering you can make same day ADRs at a lot of the DL\/DCA restaurants, but having fought for getting times at WDW I just wanted to take care of this early. We are looking at all the usual suspects: Blue Bayou, Carthay Circle, Napa Rose, Wine Country Trattoria, and Cafe Orleans.

  "text":"Hi all,\n\n\nAs a (USA) east-coaster I'm a frequent visitor to Disney World, but I've never been to Disneyland. I know tickets go on sale tomorrow for the 2017 D23 Expo, and my friend and I are planning to go. Has anyone been? \n\n\nWe have plenty of time to plan, but I have a couple of logistics questions. The Expo is at the Anaheim Convention Center... which looks, per Google Maps, like it's across the street from California Adventure. Is that really the case? Would it make sense to stay in one of the Disneyland resort hotels for the convention? We'd ideally like to go to the expo from Friday-Sunday, then visit the two parks on Monday and Tuesday. Can we stay in the same hotel all the way through? Would we need to rent a car for any of this? (In a perfect world we'd like to go to Comic-Con the following weekend, so we might need a car for that, unless you can get from Disneyland to the Amtrak station without it.)  \n\n\nReally appreciate any insight!! Thanks!",

  "title":"Trip Report - 7\/16\/16 - Tremendous Production Values, Some Flawed Ride Experiences",
  "text":"My group of friends and I (mid 20s-mid 30s) went on our annual trip to The Magic Kingdom this past Saturday and, of course, had a terrific time. We spent just under 12 hours there, arriving after noon and leaving at midnight, managing to fit in all the rides and shows we had intended. \n\n\nTL;DR:\n This trip reaffirmed for all of us that Disneyland remains the king of production value in all its shows, but, perhaps in a quest to optimize for line length over ride experience consistency, it has allowed some of its best attractions to sink to unpredictable levels of disrepair. \n\n\nThe Highs\n\n\n\n\nPaint the Night Parade\n\nAfter getting to see the final few minutes of the early show behind several rows of standing people, my group and I watched the whole late performance right in front of Small World, and I can safely say that I've never seen a light show like this (and I've been to several \nInsomniac festivals\n). Every single float was uniquely designed, perfectly capturing the spirit of its associated movie (both \nMonsters Inc.\n and \nFrozen\n were top notch), the dancers were spot on, and the final float, atop which Mickey rode, \nmay be the most brilliantly engineered light display ever built.\n\n\n\n\nFireworks\n\nLast year we viewed the show from the far end of Main Street, and this year we prioritized food over direct viewing angle, and watched from the Tomorrowland eatery. What's incredible about the show is that it is so good, that even when you are viewing from a low quality vantage point, it's still breathtaking. As one friend of mine commented \"we should do fireworks and food more often.\" \n\n\n\n\nCast Members (99% of them)\n\nI'm constantly impressed with how friendly, helpful, and kind the cast members are, especially during the long, hot days of summer. Some standouts included the Magic Shop salesman, who demonstrated an incredible trick for us twice (which we ended up buying); my cashier at Plaza Inn, just the warmest smile you've ever seen; the guy at Indiana Jones, who let me leave the line (after waiting for 20 minutes) to run to the bathroom, then come back and rejoin my group; the Indiana Jones ride loader to whom I said \"we're 7 people, and I really want to drive!\" who smile and directed us to the rows where I could drive, making sure that I was the last to board; and a group of three people near the exit who complimented several people in our group on our fashion choices. Their commitment to making park guests happy is miles ahead of any other customer service team, and its done so at an incredible scale. \n\n\n\n\nThe Rides that Were Working \nWere Working\n\n(Hyper)space Mountain, Peter Pan, Star Tours, and Splash Mountain were all tremendous. We closed the night with the Star Wars reboot of Space Mountain - our first time since the redesign - and were not disappointed. It remains the best ride at Disneyland, IMO. Peter Pan, though a 40-minute wait, is still magical after all these years (though we all wished it had been about 30 minutes longer). The new(ish) Star Tours content is the most on-brand entertainment at the park. And Splash Mountain - even at 7pm, when getting wet is the last thing you want to do - is worth every Fastpass. \n\n\n\n\nOur Fastpass Strategy\n 1pm - Star Tours (return 4-5pm) (Space Mountain was closed for repairs at the time); 3pm - Splash Mountain (return 6:15-7:15pm); 5pm - Space Mountain (return 11:15pm-12:00am)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lows\n\n\n\n\nRides in Disrepair\n\nThis trip marks the second out of the past three where Indiana Jones has broken down towards the end while I was on the ride. During the creepy spider part (that is pretty dark to begin with) the car lurched to a stop, and the music shut off, and there were no lights. The ride then started and stopped half a dozen more times, and it was so inconsistently operating at that point that one of the people in our group thought there was a chance that the boulder was going to drop on our car. I reported this to the car unloading cast member, and he looked genuinely concerned, but I don't know what became of it.\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately it wasn't just Indiana Jones. Buzz Lightyear stopped unexpectedly towards the end of the ride. The Storybook Land Canal Boat Ride featured a high pitched noise coming from the boat engine that made the guide's explanations almost impossible to hear and ruined the tranquility that one expects from that ride. The boats in Pirates of the Caribbean backed up a few scenes behind the final ascent to the unloading area, and we kept getting bumped by the boat behind us. These are all awesome attractions, but they were also all in poor shape.\n\n\n\n\nThe Mean-Spirited Jungle Cruise Cast Member\n\nUsually one of my favorite first few rides to take, the Jungle Cruise delivered us a fellow who, when we were delayed getting back to the docks because a woman in a wheelchair was unloading, and the cast member - whom our driver remarked was \"new on the job\" - took a little longer than expected to help the woman off the boat, just went off into a string of really insensitive wheelchair and handicap jokes. One of our group members was so upset he immediately pulled up the Disneyland website and wrote to customer service about his experience (this after I had to pull him back from directly confronting the guy). It was pretty shocking, to say the least. \n\n\n\n\nStandby Line Confusion\n\nDuring peak hours of the day (5pm-ish), lines for multiple rides were not managed effectively, and so their standby lines spilled out beyond the confines of the normal line area, and it became really difficult to discern who was actually in line, and where the end of the line was. We experienced this most significantly at Indiana Jones and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. \n\n\n\n\nEffects of Star Wars Land Construction\n\nAs a huge Star Wars fan, I'm psyched about the forthcoming Star Wars land. In the meantime, however, the construction really puts a damper on a few things. First, it's a pretty significant eyesore in Critter Country. The fencing they are using to obscure the construction site is not high enough to hide it from several spots, so it really scales down the cohesive Disneyland experience. Second, it has forced Fantasmic! to temporarily shut down, which is a legendary show. Third, and this is a significantly underrated part of the construction, it eliminates the really convenient route from Frontierland to Fantasyland, which is now the quite chaotic path through Sleeping Beauty's castle. \n\n\n\n\nThe Freeway Offramp\n\nThis isn't really Disneyland's fault, but it took about 25 minutes to get from the beginning of the Disneyland Drive exit to the Disneyland parking lot (this was around 11:20am). Once in the parking lot, it flowed like clockwork, because that's how Disney does it, but the driving up to the lot was a disaster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMake no mistake, this was, as our annual trip always ends up being, one of my favorite days ever. The ride repair consistency issues, however, really need to be addressed in order to maximize the amazingness that is Disneyland, especially on key rides such as Indiana Jones. In the meantime, the shows continue to be the best I've ever seen, and the cast members - most at least - are the friendliest and most effective folks in live customer service. We'll most definitely be back next year.\n\n\nThanks everyone for reading. \n\n\n[Edited for formatting]",

It's so fascinating to read what people think the meanings of certain things in the park are. My question, simply, is what are the weirdest\/best fan theories you've heard about certain rides or the park in general.  \n\n\nPS, the weirdest theory I've read thus far is definitely that the path from Adventureland through Critter Country represents the journey of Africans to America (by way of slavery). The idea is that you start in a foreign, African-ish land, then proceed on to an American port (New Orleans Square), past an old, haunted, plantation-style mansion, and then up to a Southern-influenced wilderness, thereby mirroring the journey of many slaves.

  "text":"Good Afternoon Everyone! \n\n\nInspired by the recent, \"If you had control of updated Downtown Disney\" post and all of the replies in it I figured it would be fun to have a bit of a design contest here on \/r\/Disneyland. \n\n\nThe concept is this: You, or your team (a total of 3 people), have been assigned a section of Disneyland to be re-imagineered. Every person, or team, will have to work with the same area and try to come up with the best possible solution for fixing that area and present it to the rest of \/r\/Disneyland for approval. The person, or team, with the most approval (as voted on by the users here) will win a prize. As of right now, that prize is a month of gold each but if anyone is willing to help out with donations then I would be happy to put together a much better prize package for the winners. \n\n\nWhat do we want to see? Something that will wow us! A full story treatment if possible including designs and concept art. Put on your FULL imagineering caps and think and re-think the area being discussed. Talk to us about ride mechanics and what the guest will enjoy while on the rides and off. If you've ever wanted to be an imagineer or you think you have the imagination and project planning skills necessary then I want to see your designs! \n\n\nHere is a breakdown of how it will happen:\n\n\n\n\nTODAY: you will get an assignment for what area of the park we want to see re-designed. \n\n\n\n\nAugust 22nd: You will submit your work in progress so far in a \"Project Update\" thread. \n\n\n\n\nUsers will give you pointers, what they like and don't like that you can take back and use to tweak or not tweak your projects. This is to simulate the back and forth between the board and the imagineers.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 22nd: All projects are due in the \"Project Proposal\" thread by 5pm PST. Any project that is posted late will be removed. \n\n\n\n\nUsers of the sub will have a few days to peruse each project from top to bottom and pick their favorites. \n\n\n\n\nSeptember 26th: Voting begins\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 29th at midnight: Voting ends and a project is \"ACCEPTED\".\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 30th: The winning project is announced!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as limits to your project are concerned. I only ask that you keep the budget somewhat realistic and you be mindful of what you move. For instance: Since the train has been shut down for awhile lately, I wouldn't find it realistic to shut the train down again to move the tracks. \n\n\nYour Assignment?\n\n\n\n\nTOONTOWN\n\n\n\n\nGood luck!

So given that they have plans already for GoG, how would you bring the rest of Marvel to the park?\n\n\nHere is my plan. \n\n\nStep 1: \nMonsters, Inc, becomes a Marvel Universe dark ride. The city scape is NY, but it's not tied to any specific Franchise. The major tech research would go into push button rehabs. Where nightly or weekly different sets of Heros and Villains are setup to play out their story in the streets of NY. I know it's not California Friendly... \n\n\nStep 2: Rename DCA \nThey already removed the giant letters, the golden gate bridge,The  Whoopie Goldberg Golden Dreams thing and Soaring over California... So it's really not much of a California Adventure as it's an adventure in California... but only because it actually resides in California. \n\n\nStep 3: Hyperion theatre. It's got frozen now and money has been spent so it's not going anywhere... A rename and facade to broadway it up a bit. \n\n\nStep 4: Stage 17 is transformed into Stark Tower. The height should block the glow of GoG tower and prevent the skyline from being a glowing mess visible from Disneyland. The north side would look like a fairly modern office building with the Stark Logo only visible from DCA.  A CM entrance will give office space for on site administartion and a pent house suite that DCA can use to entertain investors or guests.\n\n\nStep 5: Muppets. \nCan Muppets Coexist with Broadway and Superheroes? I hope so. The whole cast gets super powers.",

Anyone have any suggestions as to which park we should do on which day? At the moment, we're planning Disneyland on Sunday and CA on Monday because the hours are longer at Disneyland and we're getting a hotel nearby on Sunday night, so we feel we could probably take advantage of that. On the other hand, that's a surge price day, so I'm wondering whether flipping our schedule (CA on Sunday, Disneyland on Monday) would make a significant difference with crowd levels.\n\n\nThanks! :)",

We all go into Disneyland first thing in the morning and stay until 11am when we plan to go back to our (nearby) hotel for a break. Before we leave we pick up FastPasses for Space Mountain.

In a world where recent additions have been focused on Star Wars, Marvel and Frozen it's nice to see something that may be iconically Disney in spirit. Don't forget... \"It was all started by a mouse\" :)\n\n\nLet's really hope this one pans out.

I've been poking around websites but I haven't really found any stories that are personal, narrative experiences, they're more along the lines of \"it's rumored that this happens.\" Has anyone here had paranormal experiences at Disneyland? Cast members especially, since a lot of things seem to happen after hours or in backstage areas. Thanks for any responses, I'm super curious about this!",

In one of the stores in DCA they were selling some pretty rad Disney jerseys. There was like a Mickey one, a Disneyland one, and an Oswald one. I wanted to buy one but I couldn't find my size and didn't feel like shelling out the cash at that moment. I haven't been able to find them online anywhere. Does any one know what the deal with the jerseys are? Are they only there for a select time, are they kind of exclusive? can you only buy them in the park? Wondering because I want to buy one later.

  "text":"I was going to write out a full blown trip report, but I quickly realized it was going to be the most massive wall of text I've ever put on reddit and it would take me the greater part of an hour. So yeah, here's a compact list of things we did during the trip. If anyone has questions about any of it I would be more than happy to elaborate because my entire trip was so phenomenal I could rave about it for hours.\nGroup size: 8. Ages: 2, 8, 11, 30, 37, 40, 66, 67.\nGot the two elderly some scooters to help with mobility in the park.\nHotel: Marriott on Convention Way. Absolutely love this hotel. Fantastic rooms, amazing service, ART bus stop right out front. 10\/10.\nDay 1: California Adventures\nRope drop, kids and majority of the group goto Anna\/Elsa meet and greet. I go to get Frozen and RSR fastpasses.\nMeet back up with the group in A Bug's Land. The kids ride pretty much every ride there.\nWe went back to the main square and took pictures with Minnie and Mickey.\nThe Frozen live show came next. It was super awesome. It's a must-see IMO.\nRSR next. Ofcourse everyone loved it. Must-ride.\nEarly afternoon, the group goes back to the hotel to get out of the sun and grab a nap. I stay and ride California Screamin and play carnival games.\nGroup returns, we have dinner reservations at Ariel's Grotto with the World of Color dining package. Absolutely fantastic dinner. Cannot say enough great things. Worth every penny.\nNext was Soarin'. The updated ride is awesome.\nPictures, dessert, then made our way to World of Color.\nThe reserved area from the dining package was amazing. The girls went nuts for this show.\nEnd of Day 1.\nDay 2. The group meets some characters, then heads to fantasyland.\nI goto Tomorrow Land for Star Tours fastpasses and also jump on Space Mountain solo real fast.\nMeet group in FL and we ride everything except Peter Pan.\nThen it's off to TL for Star Tours. Kids love Star Wars so that was a big hit for the group.\nBuzz Lightyear Next.\nThen to Adventureland for lunch at Aladdin's Oasis. Paint the night dining package. This meal was nothing fancy, but still exceeded my expectations. Really good food for the price. Fast passes for PtN early parade.\nJungle Cruise\nIndiana Jones\nTarzan's Treehouse\nBack to Toontown, but all the rides had huge wait times. Skipped em all.\nBack into FL for Peter Pan and the carousel again.\nThunder Mountain Rail Road.\nPirates of the Caribbean\nGrabbed dinner at Hungry Bear\nTook this time to do shopping, pin trading, etc.\nHeaded to the PtN reserved seating area by Small World.\nPaint the Night parade (absolutely amazing)\nStayed in place for the fireworks (super awesome)\nFinding Nemo\nSpace Mountain\nDone.\nThis was honestly the best trip I've ever had in Disneyland and I've been many times as an adult. Something about having my nieces there for their first time really took it to a new level.\nHere is a little video I made from our trip. It's mostly portrait pictures but I love it anyway.  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/lqd768tWfPc",

  "title":"Trader Sam's and the Creepy Captain",
  "text":"My wife and I bought a one-day park-hopper pass and drove down Friday night for a blitzkrieg of both parks on Saturday. We had a late check-in to one of the budget hotels on Harbor blvd, but made the effort to walk all the way to Trader Sam's at 12:30; we arrived in time for last call. We ordered our drinks and sat inside until we were forced out to the fireplace. The only people left were a bunch of 20-something party types who had obviously been drinking for awhile, and we were a bit surprised by the Vegas-nightlife type crowd. We left when a petite young lady lay puking on the ground across her boyfriend's lap.\n\n\nFast-forward to Saturday; we spent the full day at the park - opening to about an hour after the park closed (1am). We were pretty exhausted by this point - I had been up 24 hours the day before and got about 3 and 1\/2 hours of sleep before waking up to go to the park, but we were determined to squeeze as much experience as we could, so we went over to Trader Sam's again and got a table inside. We immediately noticed an older man (say 65 years old) wearing all white - white Bermuda shorts, white button-up short-sleeved-shirt and a \nCaptain's hat.\n He was visibly drunk, and being... overly friendly to two 30-something women sitting at the bar. He then moved over to another table, next to ours, and began being a bit obnoxious to the group, who basically told him to go fly a kite - so he returned to the lady at the bar, and in a creepy move I can still see when I close my eyes, wrapped an arm around her bare shoulder, while clutching her other shoulder and wispered something into her ear with his tobacco- stained teeth. The other lady in the pair got the bartender's attention who immediately confronted the creepy old man by politely asking him not to touch the other patrons. The old man doubled down by turning his body away from the bartender and pretended to ignore him while placing another hand on her shoulder. The bartender was having none of this, and quickly escalated his end of the conversation to calling the cops if he didn't comply. The bartender handled the whole situation like a boss - being both calm, but incredibly firm without a possibility of misunderstanding. About 30 seconds of uncomfortable back and forth ensued before the creep erupted in anger and frustration and stormed out in a cuss-laden tyrade as the bartender was calling the police. We were really immpressed at how quickly, and unflinchingly, the whole situation had been handled. I tipped him 20 bucks on the spot and thanked him for doing the right thing - it seemed like the least anyone could do in the moment.\n\n\n5 minutes later a huge wedding party came in and were immediately cutoff due to how obnoxious they were (cutoff by the same bartender - my favorite cast member of the trip). The wife and I decided to move out to the fireplace to finish our drinks and watched these people stumble around in very elegant dress.\n\n\nSo when did this place turn into a hangout spot fot people seeking a Vegas style vacation? Don't get me wrong, I love to drink and party - my wife and I are both 30, but there should be a place free from this kind of behavior for families to come to vacation, and we don't even have kids. I don't want Trader Sam's to disappear, but how long before these people ruin it for the rest of the responsible people?",

  "title":"From Australia to Disneyland in February 2017",
  "text":"Hi guys,\n\n\nI have a few questions in regards to an upcoming day I'll be spending with my partner in Disneyland. I am a massive Disney fan and, as we are traveling all the way to the US for other reasons, I insisted that we spend at least one day in Disneyland. My partner doesn't really care for Disney, but he is happy to indulge me for a day and follow dutifully whilst I greet Disney princesses and make him wear mouse ears. As a compromise, I assured him that I will make the day as enjoyable and relaxing as possible.\n\n\nNow, onto my questions:\n\n\n\n\nBased off all my research, February is apparently one of the quieter times in the Disneyland calendar, so we chose a midweek day in latish February that didn't fall on any American holiday. However, according to the Crowd Forecaster linked in the sidebar, the entire week is supposed to be packed! Can anyone advise me why this might be the case? \n\n\n\n\nAs someone who's most partial to the Disney Renaissance (Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King are my favourites), what should I look out for? There doesn't seem to be many rides or attractions related to that period of Disney films, but are there any shops, attractions, or little easter eggs I should look out for?\n\n\n\n\nI've read plenty of lists where people discuss their Must Do's, but honestly, none of them strike me as something my partner or I really need to do. We're not really there for all the rides, we'll just be happy to be taking in the sights and the parades and trying a few attractions. With that in mind, is there any thing (be it ride, entertainment, or experience) that \nyou\n feel is an essential part of the Disneyland experience? \n\n\n\n\nWe have only one day to spend at the park. I've heard a few people say that it's a waste to spend one day in Disneyland, but seeing as my partner and I don't have kids and probably won't be lining up for heaps of rides, should we consider getting Parkhopper tickets and checking out California Adventure? Or should we just focus on Disneyland?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny advice you could give me would be greatly appreciated (especially regarding why the entire forth week of Feb is apparently packed). Have a great day!\n\n\nADDITION: Thank you all so much for all your advice! I wasn't expecting to receive so many comments or so much valuable advice so thank you all so much! I'm so glad there's a community of experienced Disneyland people to draw information from. All of you have wonderful days! ^_^",

I've prayed about this and I feel like I'm doing the right thing so please hear me out and do not at all feel obligated to help. (I'm a cast member at disneyland and thought maybe someone would care about this on reddit)\n\n\nA couple months ago I got in touch with a family. Their brother has Dubowitz Syndrome and not a whole lot of friends. These people were real. These people showed love and compassion even in a hard circumstance. I became friends with them and I ended up sending a care package with Disney goodies inside. \n\n\nFast forward to now. \n\n\nI see so many people a day. At work. On the freeway. In my housing development. Some are on the low spectrum of finances. Some work 70hrs a week to make ends meet. Some get to bring their families into Disneyland but don't have a single dime to spend on souvenirs and some can't even afford to send their families here at all. They may never see a Disney castle in their lifetime. Some families have medical issues that aren't as severe as the make a wish families but still deserve a vacation. \n\n\n(Stay with me. I know this post is long.)\nthe point I am making is that God put me on this earth to show kindness and give back. So I started sending care packages. I would love to be able to send 5 a month. Right now I am doing this out of pocket and it's difficult with Joel and I's income. So that is where you come in...... Each care package is going to have around 40$ of disney swag, including but not limited to a post card with signed character autographs. Management at Disneyland has been amazing with helping with the autographs of some very famous characters but I am not making enough financially to fund all these packages and pay for shipping. \n\n\nThat being said..... if you would like to help donate to this in any way, please get in touch with me via reddit messenger. Even a dollar would help. Even sharing this post could make a difference. Alone I can show kindess, but with help from others we could spread so many smiles to families that maybe haven't smiled that much or deserve a surprise in the mail.",

Each package will including 40-50$ of disney swag as well as a handmade post card signed by various characters at Disneyland and a hand written letter from myself. \n\n\nThe goal of these packages is to send magic to low income families or families with medical issues that would hinder them from making it into the park. \n\n\nEveryone deserves a chance to feel Disney like we do as cast members and guests. As a cast member I see first hand the impact a smile has on a family. \n\n\nI am open to ideas about determining the distribution of these packages.

The guy next to me said \"these bubbles sure taste good!\" The mother looked at him, shrugged her shoulders, and said 'this is a kids park.'\" The complaining people got up and left. She then had the nerve to tell her husband that people were being rude to her and he immediate gave me the stink eye.\n\n\nJUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE KIDS DOESN'T MEAN YOU (OR YOUR KIDS) GET TO INCONSIDERATE OF OTHERS.\n\n\nAnother bubble story -- at security. A woman tried to bring her kids bubble guns into the park and was denied. She was screaming at security that Disney bubble guns she bought last year were expensive and they they \"should have known they were going to be banned.\" Yeah, they should have predicted terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernadino, lady.

So THAT end of the bayou is holding back water with a lip. But what about the banjo-pickin' skulll-warnin' end? My memory of that part of the ride doesn't include a lip or hump anywhere.

I'm really looking forward to see what people have come up with!\n\n\n\n\nInspired by the recent, \"If you had control of updated Downtown Disney\" post and all of the replies in it I figured it would be fun to have a bit of a design contest here on \/r\/Disneyland. \n\n\nThe concept is this: You, or your team (a total of 3 people), have been assigned a section of Disneyland to be re-imagineered. Every person, or team, will have to work with the same area and try to come up with the best possible solution for fixing that area and present it to the rest of \/r\/Disneyland for approval. The person, or team, with the most approval (as voted on by the users here) will win a prize. As of right now, that prize is a month of gold each but if anyone is willing to help out with donations then I would be happy to put together a much better prize package for the winners. \n\n\nWhat do we want to see? Something that will wow us! A full story treatment if possible including designs and concept art. Put on your FULL imagineering caps and think and re-think the area being discussed. Talk to us about ride mechanics and what the guest will enjoy while on the rides and off.

  "text":"Taking the family (including 2 kids, 8 and 13) to Disneyland December 24th thru the 30th. We will be in the park 5 days - Christmas Day thru the 29th. We are well aware of the crowds and I think we're prepared for that. I think.\n\n\nMy hotel options are:\n\n\nPark Vue Inn- I've stayed here before, as well as almost every hotel on Harbor. I already have a queen\/bunk bed room booked. The rate per night is pretty darn affordable and it's right across the street! Close to cheap food and convenience stores. The room is absolutely tiny which usually wouldn't be a factor, but with the crowds, we may be spending more time in the room than usual. \n\n\nParadise Pier Hotel- least expensive Disney property. Still, about 1\/3 more expensive than PVI. Through a vacation package, we will get premium character dining included, and the kicker- Magic Morning included for each day of our 5 day stay. We have never stayed on Disney property so it would be kinda cool to spend Christmas Eve \"in the magic\". It's so much further away than PVI though! \n\n\nSo, is the Magic Morning going to be super helpful for Christmas week? Will the distance between PPH and the main gate be prohibitive? Is PPH even that much \"nicer\" than PVI?",

  "title":"Alright, I'm officially Team Disneyland",
  "text":"I just got back from a few days at the World, and yep, I definitely prefer Disneyland.  \n\n\nI took my first trip to Disneyland last May and my initial impression was \"Cool, its like a super concentrated version of Disney World\"  All the big rides, less of the filler.  Spending a few days traipsing around World made me appreciate that even more.  In this case, bigger isn't better.\n\n\nI found myself wishing for the simplicity of just being able to walk between parks or to the Downtown Disney area and not have to wait around for a bus.  The fact that it was August and you couldn't breathe without breaking a sweat certainly didn't help.  Certainly wished for that lovely, reliable Southern California weather.\n\n\nA whole lot of World is just wasted space currently.  Epcot is a shadow of its former self.  Animal Kingdom has my favorite ride (Expedition Everest) but I've always found it to be lacking the same Disney magic at other parks.  Maybe the Avatar area will amaze, but it's not something I'm particularly enticed by.  Hollywood Studios might be my favorite park in World, but its under heavy construction right now with Toy Story and Star Wars moving in.  I realized that so much of what I love about it is the old Hollywood aesthetic that you can find in California Adventure.  Magic Kingdom is solid, new Fantasyland looks really good. Its pretty awesome you can stand right in the middle of the fireworks during Wishes.   But World has the lesser version of Pirates, and while its Jungle Cruise is longer, that ancient ruins portion comes with complete silence from the skipper, so what's the point?  The fact that Big Thunder Mountain was closed for refurb didn't help things either, but hey, what can you do?\n\n\nAfter each long day hopping around the parks, I'd find myself ready to just head back to my hotel.  At Land, it was a 2 minute uber ride.  At World?  Another bus trip and a long wait to go with it if your timing is bad.\n\n\nSo yeah, I'm declaring for Team Disneyland.  Its everything I love about Disneyworld, and then some, and in a much more convenient and more accessible package.  There's always just a different air of magic at Land, where as World feels very much like what it is; Disneyland blown up into a full resort.",

I have a couple questions for anyone who would like to help us make our trip the best possible! \n\n\n\u2022 We're staying at Best Western raffles Inn. Has anyone stayed there? Opinions? I wanted to be walking distance. Not the greatest hotel from the looks, but it was only $94 a night, so I went for it. \n\n\n\u2022 Are the decorations worth it? Whats the must see? My daughter has never been, and my Husband only once for one day on our honeymoon, it wasn't enough time to experience it all! \n\n\n\u2022 Best place to do a character dinner? My daughter loves all things Disney, so no specific character matters. \n\n\n\u2022Should we do park hopper all three days? \n\n\n\u2022Can you take food in the park? I've read some comments on here that say you can, but on the Disneyland website it says no. My mom is a diabetic, so I'm guessing she'll be able to bypass this for health reasons? We plan on eating at the park, but want to have snacks on hand just in case. What is their water bottle policy?\n\n\n\u2022 I'm hoping it will rain, and lower crowds a little, being from Oregon, the rain won't bother us. Has anyone been at that time and remember what the weather was like? \n\n\n\u2022 My daughter is 6, should I bring an umbrella stroller for her? I'm thinking yes, not only for if she gets tired but also to store a backpack on the handles for whatever and anything we might buy. \n\n\n\u2022Basically just any tips or tricks suggestions you might have will be really helpful. We live in Oregon, and won't make it back for a couple years at least. I want to make the most of it. \n\n\nThanks in advance for all your help! That's  all I can think of for now, feel free to add whatever! These might seem like silly questions, but I'm a planner, and want to be fully prepared.

The Falcon needs a Pilot and Co-pilot, instead of those roles being used by guests, what if it was Chewie and C3-PO? And the guest's role is shooting the blasters? It would be awesome, sitting in the cockpit of the Falcon with Chewie and C3-PO Audio-Animatronics talking to you, giving you orders and telling you what to do, and also bickering between them. \n\n\nEdit:to expand on this. Chewbacca and C3-PO would be animatronic, Chewie would be sitting in the pilots seat, and 3-PO would be in the co-pilot seat. There would be two seats right behind them for the navigators. The Navigators would have a console infront of each of them, and would be given A B C or D options, or something of the like, and they would choose which planets to jump to Light speed to, and wether to go left or right, ect.

I live in Seattle, so I don't really see him and his family much other than when there's a funeral for another family member or when I visit Southern California. Well, he has now gotten my husband and I into the park in May of 2014 and last February (2016).  My husband and I are planning to take a road trip to SoCal this April and my husband says we should go to Disneyland while we're there. I'm all for it since it's my favorite place in the world. However, he wants me to ask my family member to let us in once again, and I feel like that may be asking too much since we were just there. Our oldest daughter just turned 3, so now we have 3 tickets to purchase, which obviously gets expensive, but I'd almost rather pay than ask my \"uncle\" (as I call him) to let us in free again. My husband says that if I'm not willing to ask my uncle then we're not going, and that my uncle seemed genuinely happy to get us in. My question: how would you feel about a situation like this?

The pictures I've seen of the seasonal decorations this time of year are just lovely and I can't wait to experience the holiday themed rides, except one...the Haunted Mansion, and its all because of the Holiday overlay. Don't get me wrong, I went to Disneyland for the first time during the Christmas season last year and I was blown away by the Haunted Mansion Holiday, it was one of my favorite parts of that visit, but for Halloween it just doesn't quite fit. I know its the Nightmare Before Christmas themed which is a mash-up of Halloween and Christmas but it just seems more Christmas-y to me. The original version of the ride seems way more appropriate for this time of year. Is it just me or does the Holiday overlay timing seem a bit...off? Does it make sense for anyone else for the ride to be in its original state for Halloween and then updated to the Holiday overlay some time in mid-to-late November? It's been so long since I've seen the original ride and I'm kind of bummed my Halloween trip won't include it.",

My last \"real\" visit was back in early 2010 - since then, I've had a day in DL (2012, where I mostly babysat - the new Star Tours was about the only ride I got on) and a couple hours at Trader Sam's last year.\n\n\nThis means I haven't seen any of the \"new\" DCA (World of Color, Buena Vista Street, Cars Land, Soarin' Around the World...)\n\n\nWhat's new in DL since I've been? I know I'll miss Paint the Night, but I'm ok with an MSEP nostalgia trip instead. But with only 1 day, and the railroad and river closed? No Fantasmic? Having to avoid Mickey's Halloween Party in October, or miss Space Mountain in November? (I haven't experienced Ghost Galaxy either.)\n\n\nI know I'll be back, at least, for a longer trip next summer - which may or may not be after the big construction closures are over. But I want to sneak a day in now while I have the opportunity. What would you do? Is it worth shelling out the extra time and money to park hop, see the new and improved DCA (which will still be there next year), and say goodbye to Tower of Terror (which... will still be in Florida, I guess, I've never been)? Or would I be better off doing DL only, and having a less hectic visit?\n\n\nAny other tips? Is it true that they actually enforce the 1 hour Fastpass \"window\" now? (I read the FAQ, I know it's true, it just blows my mind.) Any cool additions to classic attractions? (Preferably without spoilers - I heard Indy and Mansion both got some impressive new effects in the last year or so?) How accurate is that \"Crowd Forecast\" site in the sidebar?

  "text":"I thought I'd share a story about what happened on my last visit to the park and how it confirmed why Disney making changes to classic attractions is a positive thing overall. \nI wanted to check out the new Frozen play and managed to get their early so I could get a seat close to the stage.  Seated in front of me is a family with a little girl and as the play went on I noticed how invested she was to the story.  At the emotional part where Elsa shuts out Anna and the parents die the little girl started crying hysterically.  Instead of being upset at the distraction I was really moved at how deeply the little girl connected with the story. She clearly connected with that loss in a really meaningful way and it made me enjoy the play that much more seeing through her eyes. It also got me thinking about all the complaints when it was announced Aladdin was going to be replaced and similar ones for the Star Wars Land and the Tower of Terror changes.\nThere are tons of kids and even adults just like that little girl who connect so deeply with these new properties that are being introduced it can only be a good thing. I know not everyone can relate to that but to me that seems to be what the spirit of Disneyland is about.\n\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading all this.",

I've been tossing the idea around - just not sure if I should pull the trigger or not.  I'm thinking just a quick two day visit - one day for each park and a hotel room for the night.  I know it may be tough to pull off, but I don't know when I would ever be on the west coast or close enough to make this DL visit possible ( I live in New Orleans).  Money is a slight factor.  We would be looking at between $300-$350pp, and the would include tickets, room, rental car, and gas.  \n\n\nWould two days be enough time to explore both parks?  How busy is DL\/DCA during Thanksgiving week?  Should I just enjoy Vegas with my mom and sister and let go of the idea of squeezing in this mini-vacay?  Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!! Thanks y'all!!\n\n\nEDIT:  Thanks so much, guys!!  I have spoken to my mom and sister about everything y'all have said.  My mom actually found a Disney gift card from back in 2012 when she originally opened her Disney Visa card, and it still has $200 on it!  So, staying Sunday 11\/20-Monday 11\/21 at good neighbor Motel 6 with two day tickets (no PH) is $724, minus her $200 gift card, brings it down to $524 - or roughly $175pp!!  We are booking as we speak!!  I am beyond excited right now!!  Talk about a memorable mother-daughter girls trip we are gonna have!!",

Every person, or team, will have to work with the same area and try to come up with the best possible solution for fixing that area and present it to the rest of \/r\/Disneyland for approval. The person, or team, with the most approval (as voted on by the users here) will win a prize. As of right now, that prize is a month of gold each but if anyone is willing to help out with donations then I would be happy to put together a much better prize package for the winners. \n\n\nWhat do we want to see? Something that will wow us! A full story treatment if possible including designs and concept art. Put on your FULL imagineering caps and think and re-think the area being discussed. Talk to us about ride mechanics and what the guest will enjoy while on the rides and off. If you've ever wanted to be an imagineer or you think you have the imagination and project planning skills necessary then I want to see your designs! \n\n\nHere is a breakdown of how it will happen:\n \n\n\n\n\nTODAY: All projects are due in the \"Project Proposal\" thread by 5pm PST tomorrow. Any project that is posted late will be removed. \n\n\nUsers of the sub will have a few days to peruse each project from top to bottom and pick their favorites. \n\n\nSeptember 27th: Voting begins\n\n\nSeptember 29th at midnight: Voting ends and a project is \"ACCEPTED\".\n\n\nSeptember 30th: The winning project is announced!\n\n\n\n\nAs far as limits to your project are concerned. I only ask that you keep the budget somewhat realistic and you be mindful of what you move.

There are a lot of things I want to potentially do for The Disney Company \/ Disneyland in the future but due to their hiring process, I feel discouraged.\n\n\nIt seems like there's literally no way to contact a specific department or really reach out and show your interest. I can't just call up imagineering, entertainment, guest services, or whatever else. I have to religiously look at their outdated, confusing website every few months to see if there is an opening. Once you apply, you don't know where your application goes from there. There's not much you can do to make yourself stand out which is unfortunate. If they don't contact you after you went through their lengthy online process, you don't even know why. Someone might've just sped through your application for all you know!\n\n\nIt seems like a lot of people that've gotten their dream jobs at Disneyland have worked there for a significant amount of time and \"worked their way up,\" which is impressive but not ideal for the average person. Disneyland emphasizes getting your foot in the door no matter the field you're going for, but maybe someone doesn't want to work a few years, (or a few decades) to work in their desire field. As many of you cast members and Disney mega fans know, being a cast member isn't easy.\n\n\nEvery time I hear someone say they want to work a specific job at Disneyland or for the Disney company, I wonder if they know the actual process. \"Apply online and then do the college program and then this internship program and then you'll work in this department and maybe switch two years later yadayada.\" Seems exhausting.\n\n\nThere just seems to be a sort of disconnect. I've applied for a lot of opportunities there for years and never hear back when I know I'm qualified. In the past, I usually get jobs by meeting someone or actually talking to someone, showing them my passion, my personality, my style. But through an online form I feel limited, especially considering the person looking at my application probably sees hundreds a day and doesn't even work in the field I want. \n\n\nHonestly, I get that Disney is a huge company and all so it isn't going to be super personal. However...even if their website was more modern and personal I would be happy. It seems hard to navigate, like it's from the mid 2000s or something. \n\n\nAnyone else feel this way or have any tips to apply to jobs at Disneyland in a more personal way?",

Our Friday and Sunday tickets will be for Disneyland and our Saturday ticket will be for California Adventure. How does walking through DCA to get to Disneyland work without park hoppers?\n\n\nI'm a planner and this not knowing how it'll go is stressing me. \ud83d\ude01",

It was BACKED UP so much, but to our surprise we ended up getting free parking for having 4 annual pass holders in our car. We got into the park at about 7:45pm. We were super excited right off the bat because of the cool lights\/fog they have by the gates and at the train station. We decided to do some rides, and to our surprise all of the lines were super short! We got on Pirates, HM, and Space Mountain with only a 5 minute wait or less. All of the other rides had short lines as well, but we decided to stake out some spots for the parade.\n\n\nI was most excited for the parade, but I ended up being disappointed by it :\/ It was fairly short and the floats were pretty lack luster. It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't as great as I thought it would be based off of the advertisements for it.\n\n\nAfter the parade we went on Peter Pan which had about a 25 minute wait and then decided to head out for the night. I was surprised by how much fun I had! I loved seeing everyone dressed up and all of the creative costumes that people come up with. \n\n\nTo answer some questions that I have frequently seen on this sub regarding MHP; There were a ton of adults in full out costumes. I say a bunch of adults wearing full length capes and nobody seemed to have a problem with it. I also used face paint on half of my face and it wasn't a problem. I suggest getting there early so you don't get stuck in the traffic!",

  "text":"So, here's the deal, I'm on a great American road trip, and while I wasn't going to go to Disney originally, now I'm in California and have gotten tempted. BUT I have a service dog, Drago. He's lovely, and super, and I owe him my life, but he's not allowed on roller coasters. (To be fair, he'd probably hate roller coasters.) Well, I actually really love roller coasters, but since I'm on this trip solo I either have to put Drago in the kennel there (Which really doesn't appeal to me for a number of reasons.)\nOr I have to find someone who's comfortable with Rider Swapping all day long and holding onto him while I ride. You wouldn't have to take care of anything else just hold onto him for the length of time it takes for me to ride a ride.\nI realize this is a pretty big ask, especially on fairly short notice.\n\n\nI'm date flexible, but somewhere between Oct 5 and 12, weekdays preferable but not required. But I'm cheap, and saving 10 bucks and not dealing with the extra crowdedness of weekend appeals to me.\n\n\nI'd obviously have to be comfortable with whoever I'm going to hand over my lifeline too, so I'd really like to talk and get to know you beforehand.\n\n\nAbout me: I'm a 22-year-old girl, I've been traveling the US and Canada by myself since May and have been looking for where I want to settle down and generally just having fun adventures because now was the time that these adventures were doable. Favorite Disney movie is probably Hunchback of Notre Dame or Treasure Planet (Which does not get nearly the love it deserves). I've been to Disneyland once before when I was I think around age 9 or 10?\n\n\nSo yeah, if you think that Rider Swapping with me all day is the kind of kindly thing you'd like to do, let me know here or in a PM. I can't really offer you much in return, but I'll at least buy you a meal, and if you like German Shepherds, you get to hang out with one.\n\n\nEDIT: So, after collecting all the information I could I understand the service dog kennels a lot better and feel comfortable that I'll be able to do what I want to at the park without rider swapping. So while I appreciate so many people being so willing to volunteer, I shouldn't need to rely on anyone for my time there. That said, if you are going to be in the park on the 4th, it might be nice to talk a little more so that maybe I still have a backup plan if the kennels don't work out. Or if you just see a girl in a Beauty and the Beast skirt and with a German shepherd, come say hi!",

  "title":"A Day at Disneyland: Featuring Drago the Service Dog",
  "text":"Incoming massive post probably. Or I'll pass out before I finish typing this. We'll see which.\n\n\nI posted earlier in the week looking for someone to go to Disneyland with to rider swap with my service dog with. Ultimately I ended up going by myself after getting more information on the crates available for service dogs. This was my experience with the day:\n\n\nBefore we even left the hotel room, Drago was kitted out in all his gear: Vest, boots, a white ribbon with glowsticks on it to help him be more visible in some of the darker waiting areas of Disney. And his hearing protection in my bag for whatever loud noises we might encounter.\n\n\nWe arrived early, and were in the park right at opening and went straight to City Hall just to make sure we were all squared away with everything we needed to know for the day. Drago got a \"First Visit\" button, and I got a \"Celebrating\" button, and off we went. Our first ride of the day was Pirates of the Caribbean. Which was possibly a risky move on my part, but he did excellently. The first drop he was a little confused and concerned, but not panicked. The second drop he accepted that that was just something that happened here. The rest of the ride he just sat and watched everything.\n\n\nI headed on to Critter Country, only to learn that all of Critter Country is closed. :( So we just winged it and headed along to Thunder Mountain. This was Drago's first experience being put in one of the crates they have available. He's not really overly fond of anything that separates us, but he went in. The crates were a little on the small side for him. He fit, and could lay down inside, but any repositioning was sort of a complicated thing. I'd certainly never put him in that kind of crate for a long time, but for a few ten minute intervals spread out throughout the day, it worked. The crate was just off the loading station and behind a gate, certainly not too out of the way, although they did position it at the top of the stairs making getting him in and out a little bit more challenging. \nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/VvY38ik.jpg\n\n\nNext we went and recreated the famous \"Partners\" statue \nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/kzCoMtp.jpg\n, and then on to Fantasyland! After Pirates, these rides were a piece of cake to Drago. (Sorry, crappy photos: \nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/pJnW2j5.jpg\n \nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/JrPjEZA\n) Hardest part was just ducking his head under the lap bar. Then he just sat on the floor next to\/in front of me and poked his head up to watch everything. At first I tried to just go in the normal lines, not really seeing any reason not to. But, the cast members seemed pretty insistent Drago get treated like a wheelchair, so I just went where they told me to. By the end of the day I was pretty grateful for it though. The constant up and down and stopping and going of standing in line is a lot harder on Drago than on me. I'm not gonna pretend it isn't also just nice and totally does get me to the front faster, even when they issue me a return time, but it also does have a purpose even if I didn't realize at first the difference it made versus navigating a German Shepherd down the queues.\n\n\nThat said, Disney's signage to access entrances and directions for people who need DAS is not the best. I was constantly having to refer back to the disabilities guide map and almost always just ended up asking every CM along the way which way to go anyway. Several times I would go where the map said, only to get told by a CM I actually had to go somewhere else. I had been issued and used two return times already, but for some reason on the third was told that I wasn't actually set up for DAS yet and had to be put into the system for it.\nUltimately it came down to just constantly asking every CM I met along the way if I was going the right way\/do I need a return time for this ride\/where do I get the return time\/and where do I return to when it is time?\n\n\nThroughout the day I saw four other dogs. The first was a small white one that sat quietly in its handlers lap in a wheelchair and hardly even flinched at everything going on (A+). The second, was a small white one being carried around by a man that barked and growled at Drago every time we walked by and all while we stood in line behind it in line for a Dole Whip (F). I don't particularly feel bad about him leaving the line to go keep his dog quiet, when clearly his dog should not have been there. If your dog is well-behaved enough to pass as a service dog even if you don't actually need one, then maybe that's still not really the right thing to do, but I won't have any grounds to call you out on it. This dog wasn't passing, and it showed. We encountered a brown poodle looking dog, that did bark once or twice at Drago, but ultimately was standing nicely next to its handler (B). The last one we walked right past and it never even noticed Drago or I, but this was the end of the day, so maybe it was just tired. (Ungraded)\n\n\nService dog relief areas:\nThere are three marked on the map, not counting the one by the kennels outside of Disneyland itself. I only went to two of the three, and both were a challenge to get to even being marked on the map. One was marked with a sign maybe only 3 or 4 inches wide, and the other had no sign at all. You just have to circle the approximate area on the map and look for a small gate in the fences around the grassy areas. The spaces really made me feel like I wasn't supposed to be there since you have to go into these fenced off areas and everything I've been taught in my entire life is that little decorative fences are there to tell you to stay off the grass. Thankfully Drago isn't shy, because there's certainly quite an audience while he does his business.\n\n\nAll in all, we had a great day. Drago's exhausted, but he did amazingly. The only ride he had trouble with was Dumbo because he didn't like the gap he had to step over to get in, so the first time we tried I opted just to leave rather than force him into anything he wasn't comfortable with. We came back at the end of the day and he got right on. And other than sneaking one piece of dropped popcorn or french fry or whatever it was while I was sitting down for lunch, he stayed focused all day and I am so proud of him. Disneyland truly is the ultimate testing ground for a service dog. If they can handle it there, they're ready for anything.\n\n\nPlenty of people commented on his boots and his ears (\nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/PdT39EW.jpg\n I would set them on him whenever we were sitting down for a while. I wore them otherwise) Plenty of people took his picture, some asked, some didn't I don't really care if he gets his picture taken either way, but it is nice when people ask first... (If you happen to be one of the people who took his picture, I'd love to see it!)\n\n\nTL;DR: Drago the service dog did awesome at Disneyland. Disneyland needs better signage and consistency for where people with access needs go to get on rides.",

  "title":"Disneyland advice, tips, tricks as of October 2016 (adding as people add their comments)",
  "text":"I typed in \"Disneyland advice\" and stuff popped up from a year ago. All helpful still but in case anyone wants to read the 2016 version in one place.\n\n\n(If I could copy and paste everyone's responses from past posts, I would, but can't... only you can prevent forest fires). No I meant only you can edit and copy your comments to repost here.\n\n\nJust came back from Disneyland for a couple days (also was a pass holder for 2 years ago about 6 years ago).  I still love it all the same.\n\n\n\n\nToy Story and WOC is on a completely separate fastpass network so you can have regular fastpasses and those at the same time.\n\n\nIf you have any inkling of going on Peter Pan, go there FIRST. But you should be present at rope drop and essentially expect to wait less than 20 minutes in line for the ride. And YES, that big ol line forming when you're walking toward it, is already the line. If you don't believe so, have one person check up front and you stay in line. It only looks long because they haven't actually started the ride yet at times.\n\n\nSuggested rides\/fast pass to do first from other posters\/my experience: some say fast pass Space Mountain then ride all the short waits in Tomorrowland. Some say Fast pass Indiana Jones then ride everything in that area. Save whichever one you don't do for the last of the day. Or when your time opens up, get the fast pass for the ride you didn't do.\n\n\nAs long as you get in LINE before the park closes you'll get on the ride even after the park closes.\n\n\nAlso, I've fast passed Indiana jones first thing and got in line for it too- rode it twice in 1 day on a busy day. (Of course that's no comparison to 6 times in a row 6 years ago).\n\n\nOr, have your group wait in the Peter Pan line and you go get the fast passes, also have done that and it has worked well.\n\n\nLots of people say to bring food and don't stop anywhere. However it's a good idea to stop and eat somewhere and experience that part of Disney. Or pairs of you go eat while the rest (make it a majority of the group) wait in line. What I do is wait with the whole group first maybe 10 minutes so enough people see that you're in line. Then leave to go get food\/sit down (depending on length of line), then come back. You don't feel as bad coming back in and also the people surrounding you know you were already there and don't give you looks lol.\n\n\nGet there BEFORE rope drop especially if you are trying to do both parks in one day!! Main Street is already open so you can sight see before the rides open but even then I would say wait at the ropes if your visit is short.\n\n\nYou can hold multiple fast passes. You don't have to wait for them to be used to get another one (it will tell you on the pass when one is available again).\n\n\nIf you can't get in front of the castle for fireworks or you've already seen that view, watch it from small world and see the projections on there!\n\n\nIf you have no choice but to wait an hour in line for a ride, the ones you should wait in: Indiana since the inside is interesting to see. Cars also has some interesting stuff to see. When I went the project wait time was 75 min but it was only 45. Netflixed Friends episodes and viola I was on the ride.\n\n\nIf you have kids, PLEASE get them some pins to trade! It's so much fun for them if they're into it... also good for adults too haha.\n\n\nFor the love of goodness, buy your tickets online.  I always feel bad for the dozens of people waiting to get their tickets when you could have saved so much time. Buy them from the app or the site and go straight to the entry gates!",

  "text":"I should preface by saying I recently became an AP holder  (Signature level) so my gf and I arrived at the park a little late, around 3pm.\n\n\nWe had reservations for Cafe Orleans at 7:40 pm and spent the majority of our time at DCA. The difference in crowd size and ease of mobility is incredible. I used to think of DCA as just ok but it's really growing on me. \n\n\nWe planned on trying Soaring as she has never been on and the last time I was on it was Soaring Over California. Fastpasses were out and the wait time was too much so we headed over to Ariel's Underwater Sea Adventure. \n\n\nWe both had a really good time on that as it was both our first times. It's so colorful, bright, and fun! She had a blast which made me happy.\n\n\nNext we got on the Golden Zephyr and Jumpin' Jellyfish. I dont know if its because I'm not a young buck anymore but those rides are more intense than they look.\n\n\nWe then ate the clam chowder bread bowls at Pacific Wharf. It was delicious and a good snack before our reservation. \n\n\nAnother highlight was sitting on the pier after eating and watching the parade (not sure what it was called). As we watched from across the water we started a little game of trying to get the parade people to wave to us from across the way. By the end our little section was shouting and waving at the parade for recognition and would erupt in cheers, laughter, dancing in our seats, and thumbs up when they acknowledged us. Some fun Disney magic. \n\n\nDinner was amazing at Cafe Orleans. We checked in, gave them a number to text us when a table was ready, and got a text less than 2 minutes later.\n\n\nMy only complaint was the restaurant was a little smelly. Ya'know that half dried wet rag smell sometimes found in restaurants.\n\n\nShe ordered the vegetable ragout with salmon and a mint julep ( free refills! ). It was flavorful and well seasoned but the salmon was dry. I ordered the steak, which is part of the Halloween seasonal menu. It came with asparagus, breaded and fried green onions and garlic roasted mashed potatoes, all with a cognac sauce. My god that was one of the best steaks I've ever had! I ordered medium doneness and it actually was. So juicy and flavorful while still having that signature sear. We think they sous vide the steaks to keep it soft and juicy. The potatoes and sauce were incredibly flavorful as well. \n\n\nWe finished with the butterscotch beignets. Inside the restaurant it comes with 5. We asked if we could do 3 butterscotch and 2 regular, but no doing. \n\n\nAll in all, an excellent meal with good service but I did feel a bit rushed as it closes at 8. I recommend the steak ($23) while you can. It'll be off the menu come November.\n\n\nWe have reservations on the 29th and I just might get the steak again.",

  "text":"Coming to the Happiest Place on Earth January 30-February 3, from Canada. My sister (21) and myself (28) are spending four glorious park-hopping days in DL and DCA and I have some questions. \n\n\nWe have been to both parks in 2003, 2013, and 2014, each for three park-hopper days, so I think we are both quite comfortable with the layouts, knowing what we want and where to go, strategies, etc. We are both Disneyland obsessed and have no issue spending four days from park open to park close. You better believe we will be there as many hours as physically possible. We'd done three days in the past and that was absolutely adequate but with an extra day we really couldn't be more excited because it gives more opportunity to experience rides multiple times, and at both day time and night time. Which leads me to question one:\n\n\nHow do Big Thunder, Jungle Cruise, Autopia, California Screamin', and Mickey's Fun Wheel compare day vs night? We have only ridden these during daylight hours. Is it better to do one only in the day? I feel like JC is probably a day-only ride? Autopia I could skip but my sister wants to do it because we haven't since 2003. Is there anything I'm forgetting that we really should ride at night time? Tell me your thoughts!\n\n\nWhen does Tower of Terror close officially? I hear January. We will likely miss it won't we? :(\n\n\nI am a glasses-wearer. I know I have to take them off for California Screamin'. I have taken them off for Space Mountain every time but... do I need to? I don't think it's 'that' intense, right? I can't see crap without my glasses and I feel like I 'lose' some of the effect of the ride and I just wanna wear 'em. \n\n\nI've heard there are new bobsleds for the Matterhorn and people aren't happy 'bout it? Why? How do they compare to the old ones? when did these come into play? We love the Matterhorn so I'm just wondering what to expect.\n\n\nHas Star Tours incorporated anything from the new movie? Does Star Tours play different rides if you ride it more than once? I could take or leave Star Tours but my sister looooves it and wants to ride it more than once to get a different version of the ride.\n\n\nFebruary weather. In 2003 we went in March, 2013 in December, 2014 in November. Weather was unreal-levels of perfect every time. What's February like? We're Canadian so obviously Anaheim's \"cold\" is our \"pretty nice\". We talking hoodie-at-night or spring-jacket weather? Rain? Does rain shut rides down? Should we plan for rain or just deal with rain if it happens? Also in February should we avoid Splash Mountain and Grizzly River Run? Is it \"too cold\" for them?\n\n\nWhere is the best place to watch the nightly fireworks?\n\n\nAny special events you know of that occur on January 30-February 3? Shows? Parades? Anything we should see?\n\n\nSoarin' Over California is now Soarin' Over the World, right? How do they compare? We are weird nerds who LOVED Soarin' so much so we're looking forward to the new one.\n\n\nIs there any way to predict or like, plan for? which version you'll get on RSR? The tire-change versus the paint-job? Or is it just \"you get what you get\"? My sister has been on RSR twice and got the paint job both times, whereas I've experienced both. She is really wanting to get the tire-change one, haha.\n\n\nEating in parks - I know it's expensive and no one recommends it. We've never done it other than getting a corndog and a churro but this time around we want to eat at one of the restaurants. Which would you recommend? No dietary restrictions apply and we don't want to spend craaazy money but we would like to eat at one sit-down restaurant - doesn't matter which park.\n\n\nSorry for the wall of text.

But is that a logistically smart move?  I see you can park in the hotels if you have a dining reservation, but how long will they let you stay there?  How far of a walk are the different parking structures from the hotels and DTD?  Is there a best place to park?  This will be sometime in the week between Christmas and New Years, so I know it will be busy.  Do the parks ever totally run out of parking spaces?

This isn't just a \"yeah that'll be cool\" or a \"Disneyland is my favorite place in the world I love it so much I need to work there holy hole punch\" (Yes that's true, but it's not about that) this is heart pounding, fist clenching, teeth biting, anxiety inducing, existence questioning, life changing experience that I want and very much desire to do.

(that was sarcasm. theres not a lot of things to do in Arizona) OH YEAH! and I have no money. Onto the question... Questions....\nHow hard would it be (Is it even possible) to move to Anaheim? What would I need to do? how much to save? where to stay(LIVE)? who to meet? who to NOT meet?\n  what are the odds that I even get a job at Disneyland??? (I don't wanna move and spend lots of my minimum wage paychecks to not even access my dreams) What jobs should I look for at Disneyland? When should I apply? How do I apply? is it even worth it? (Of course it's worth it, but IS IT WORTH IT?) How would I get to Disneyland from where I'm living? If I don't get the job, how long will I have to wait to apply again? Do I need to live in California at the time to apply, or can I wait until I know I have the job for sure to actually move? Does Disneyland pay enough to live comfortably without panicking at the disco? How would I go about making more money so I can get to that point?

I'll compile all the ideas and post a completed list for people to try with their own friends and family. Thanks guys!",

  "title":"Indiana Jones ride shortened?",
  "text":"I haven't been to the parks in about 5 years and although I was disappointed by many things (quality and selection of merchandise, the new Star Tours, so many closures, getting 'lost' because now major portions of the park no longer connect) it was still super fun. However one thing was especially weird:\n\n\nIndiana Jones is my favorite ride ever since I waited to ride it the very first day. I remember that when you go in, there used to be narration that described the three doors and then some arbitrary choice was made,  then you slowly went towards the idol as it talked to you and the eyes started glowing, etc. Etc. This time we seemed to just barrel through, the idol was talking but we went so fast I can't imagine anyone riding it the first time absorbed the story.\n\n\nWas the ride malfunctioning or do they run it faster to get people in and out?",

At about 8pm we had finished dinner, paid our bill, and were sitting at our table chatting and waiting for a member of our party to return from the restroom.  At that moment, a woman came up to our table and asked us if we could leave because her group had a 7:30p reservation and they were still waiting to be seated and wanted to sit together.  She said the restaurant staff told her they would not ask us to leave so apparently she took it upon herself to do so.  I kind of laughed at her and since our friend had returned from the restroom we obliged.  As we were getting up to leave about 3 servers came up to us and apologized for what happened, explaining that they didn't tell that woman to do what she did.

  "title":"Trip Report 7\/7-7\/10",
  "text":"I was unsure of how busy our trip was actually going to be because last year I went in September and it was supposed to be a \"Ghost town\" and every ride had an hour wait the entire time. Again our crowd tracker said \"ghost town\" but this time I chose to ignore it and accept it may just be insane and I was pleasantly surprised. Monday afternoon everything was sitting around 20 minutes except Space Mountain and TOT which I expected, so we packed a lot of rides in.\n\n\n Tuesday morning we knocked out almost every ride in DL between our MM and low morning crowd levels before one which was pretty amazing when compared to our last trip. We got a FP for TOT and were a little iffy on the 40 FP wait but hey, it's going away forever! It ended up breaking down 20 minutes into our wait, but actually ended being great for us since we could use our FP for late check out! We went back just before close and basically walked on with it. I'm really happy we got to experience it, it was definitely an interesting experience. Especially for me since this was only my second visit ever, so I didn't have the ride memorized like some people do. We did Soarin over the World for the first time this day and it was really amazing. I can't say soarin over california really blew me away, but for some reason this one did! I definitely understand not liking the CGI, but overall really well done! \n\n\nOur third day was again a day of really low morning crowds. We did splash back to back in ten minutes, of course asking for the front both times and decided to run over to DCA and hope for a good wait time for TOT. It was only 30 minutes so we grabbed a FP and hopped in line, ended up timing it perfectly to ride that back to back too! \n\n\nThursday was a total chaotic zoo, but at this point we had done so much we we're fine with it and we expected it anyways because of the christmas celebration starting and the half marathon that weekend. We basically spent that day in Animation Academy with Sarah who is GREAT by the way. Definitely my favourite artist there. (We did AA like 7 times haha) My one wish for that is maybe later in the evening they could offer more \"advanced\" classes. Not adults only but it would be cool to attempt some of the drawings like the ones in the line up instead of just a portrait! \n\n\nThe only negatives of the trip was that of the 7 times we tried to ride Space Mountain, only twice was it working. We felt cursed. I wish they had some sort of standby sign for it at the entrance of Tomorrowland because that whole area just gets packed even on the quieter days and it's disappointing to trek to the very back just for it to be broken down. Again. lol. I know there's an app, but unfortunately as we're Canadian, we can't use our data without spending lots of money. My phone company has a terrible roaming data plan. I have to say I don't really see why people like Tomorrowland so much. Maybe if you went a lot years ago, but to me it just felt (sorry super fans) like a really ugly\/tacky part of the park that desperately needs TLC. Also, there was basically NO TOT merch which was really disappointing to me. I really wanted a keepsake but I think I will just have to settle for something online. I'm a petite girl so the two whole shirts they had left just weren't going to work. \n\n\nAside from that I pressed way to many pennies again, furthering my addiction. Lord help me when I go to WDW next year haha. Oh and for those of you who don't know, Flo's diner has REALLY good sides of mashed potatoes and veggies for only $2.99 which is about the cheapest snack you can get in the park and they're good for you! (basically) Flo's was the only place we came across a bad CM actually, but she was hysterically bad. A guy across from us in line was actually holding back the giggles because she was SO unimpressed with life. The most deadpan face, and she took at least two minutes to count my change. Barely spoke two words to me. It definitely didn't hamper my trip because the exchange was so absurd, but it surprised me for sure that she was still there with that attitude! \n\n\nSorry for the long rant I was just really excited to share! It was such an improved trip from last year. Thanks for reading! Have a magical day!",

  "text":"I know this trip report is old, but I really wanted to share. I don't want to bum anyone out, but I just want to warn of some dangers.\n\n\nWe went to the park on my birthday. We put our stuff in a locker on Main Street, including my limited edition Star Wars jacket that I loved so much that I got at Disneyland years before, my prized Wonderfully Wicked Chernobog pin (I was waiting to buy a lanyard to put it on), and my new purse I got for my birthday. We went to get a lanyard for my pin and when we opened the locker, it was completely empty.\n\n\nCompletely. Empty.\n\n\nThe police were as helpful as they could be. The cast members who refused to give us a poncho as it had started pouring and our jackets and wallets had both been stolen was not so much. We were told these things happen sometimes, and there are no cameras in the locker room, and there was nothing they could do.\n\n\nTwo months later they found the couple, caught them pulling the same stuff in San Diego at Sea World. They recovered a lot of stuff, including a notebook with my name and social security number in it. My beloved jacket, pin, purse, and other belongings were nowhere to be found.\n\n\nI don't say this to be \"poor me\" or to bum anyone out. I say this so no one makes the same mistakes we did. I say this to tell you: do NOT leave things you really love in the lockers. Protect protect protect your pin number. Absolutely cup your hand around it so no one else can see; don't use a pin like '1234' or '0000' (we didn't, but we found out that's common). Hang on tight to your ticket with your locker number. Be aware of your surroundings. I know it can get crazy crowded, but be aware that there are people out there that would take advantage of that to look over your shoulder at your pin number.\n\n\nI know some of this may seem common sense, but it's just so easy to throw stuff in a locker and forget about it. I don't want the heartache to happen to anyone else. It was really hard to go back to the parks after that. Over a year later and the magic has definitely returned, and I still go almost every weekend. But there are bad people out there who don't understand the love and magic that is Disneyland.

  "text":"Hi guys,\nCurrently I'm on the SoCal Select which only includes Mondays through Fridays. This was fine for me, but my GF upgraded her pass to the regular So Cal Pass that has less blackout dates and includes Sundays.\n\n\nMy pass expires the 17th of December, but I have the option to renew right now for a small discount. If I upgrade to the So Cal Pass, can I start going on Sundays right away? Or would I still have to wait until after the 17th (which would mean until January since it's blacked out from the 16th until early January)?\n\n\nIf I have to wait until the 17th, would this work? I know they usually let you enter the park on the day you get your pass (even if its a blackout date), so if say, I go on a Sunday and renew it at the park, would that work? \n\n\nThanks for the help!

Instead of paying for a wedding we paid for 18 of our closest family and friends to join us for the day.  We got married on Pirates of the Caribbean right in the start of the day.  We all went on rides, had some drinks at Trader Sams, and overall just had an incredible day.  Our friends kept telling us how fun and different of a wedding it was.  We even got to take our first husband and wife pictures at our special area in the park that we had our first kiss and I asked her to be my girlfriend years ago!\n\n\nTL;DR: If Disneyland is a special place to you, get married there.

My girlfriend renewed her pass a few weeks ago and got the SoCal pass that includes Sundays.

So basically I was going to be blocked off until January unless I went during the week this week, but I work everyday so that wasn't an option.\n\n\nI went this past Sunday and renewed my pass at one of the booths in hopes that they would let me into the park that day, since they let you in on the day you buy your annual pass even if it's blocked off, but for renewals it's apparently not guaranteed. I asked the lady who renewed my pass if I could enter the park, and she said that since it was a Sunday and my pass included Sundays, I should be fine. \n\n\nWell, I get to the gate and they scan my pass. They ask me if I just renewed my pass, and I show them my receipt, but they're asking for a different paper that I guess they're supposed to hand out to guests when they renew their pass if they want to enter the park. The lady never gave me one, so I was getting worried.

We're pretty excited, and also terrified, because we're actually going to be doing Disneyworld and Disneyland on this trip. We've been saving and saving for this trip and we're also going to be doing a Honeyfund for our honeymoon. When we were at WDW in October, we purchased the Premiere annual passports (which made us feel swanky and broke all at once). I was hoping to post our loose plan here and see what people thought and get advice as to what would be worth considering, etc.\n\n\nCurrently, we'll be staying at WDW in the Contemporary Hotel (we figure being on the main monorail loop will be huge, plus we\u2019ve always wanted to stay here) from September 9th to the 18th. On the 18th we\u2019ll fly to California and stay there for about a week in the Disneyland Hotel. We\u2019re planning on giving ourselves travel days and rest days where we roam Disney Springs \/ Downtown Disney, enjoy the pool and hotels, etc. We\u2019re also planning on doing a day at Harry Potter World in both Florida and California. \nHere is our loose plan,\n though we just plugged in random days for the specific parks as our current concern is overall time and that we'll have enough days for the parks we like to visit multiple times.\n\n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is, is there anything we should be considering about these dates, hotels, etc that stands out? You folks are all so amazing and smart that we wanted to run this by you all to see if something stood out, or if you had any advice, before we booked everything (hopefully in the next few days!). \n\n\nTL,DR: We\u2019re doing WDW and DL for our honeymoon and are seeking advice and things to consider.",

Very excited, we haven't done anything Disney since our Honeymoon in FL! \n\n\nHere's our pickle, transportation is becoming difficult. Family wise everyone is all over the place so he and I are just deciding to do our own thing to get to the property. We are staying at the Disneyland Hotel. I noticed there is no free transportation from hotels but the do offer the numbers for the bus or private services. Both expenssive but doable, but uninteresting to spend close to 2 hours on a bus to get to my hotel.\n\n\nI just wanted to ask and gather opinion on what others did to get from A to B. In Orlando we did uber to get to and from parks and it was painless and flawless. Has anyone had luck doing that in CA? \n\n\nRenting a car seems pointless as we are practically a block away from the parks\/downtown Disney. We won't be going or doing anything else. And the bus is just time consuming and a bit expenssive from my quote (96$ for 2 people). \n\n\nI appreciate all the advice and help!",

Now I know that not everything can return (Peoplemover, ete.), but certain things can. A repainting of the area to give it all a cohesive theme. The removal of the Astro-Orbiter, and put the ride back on top of the Peoplemover station. Putting something new inside the theater. Possibly a new model of progress city.\n\n\nAnd finally, a rename of the land. Instead of Tomorrowland, it could be renamed \"Walt Disney's Tomorrowland\", a callback to the Tomorrowland that he wanted built, but never lived to see come into the real world.\n\n\nThat is all of the ideas I have right now.

The only time I've ever been able to contact a human at casting was when I drove out to the agency and walked up to the front desk. What should I say to them? I was thinking something along the lines of \"I want to know the status of my application\" but then they'll just tell me to check online. What can I say to actually get stuff done? \n\n\nshould I wait until my 6 months are up and re-apply? or should I just keep pressing my current application? I've been pretty lazy about it for like 2 months. \n\n\nDoes anyone have experience working a second job along with disney? which job did you prioritize? (the position i applied for is part time and i believe my other job is full time) \n\n\nWhat part of the application determines if you get the online interview? I don't recall getting one for mine but my friend who applied (and now works there) got the online interview immediately after she applied.

On Dec 28 only 6% of the approx 80,000 guests were APs and then one week later APs were 65% of the same approx 80,000 guests.\n\n\nI have heard from multiple sources that there are a huge number of APs for DLR and they can represent up to 70% of the DLR guest population on a given day. To see these numbers (predicted, peak per park, actual at a given time, APs total) still blows my mind. CMs are right to ask every guest if they are APs for discounts because 7 out of 10 ARE!\n\n\nEven though the huge price jump hurts, the $200 Sig+ premium on the holiday weeks really helped make the experience better for the large group of non-APs visiting. Think what the parks would look like if 50,000 APs and 75,000 ticket holders wanted to go at the same time!",

Upon entering you see this \nsign\n which I think completely sums disney up perfectly. The first day was kind of an exhausting blur we tried to see as much as possible and do as much as possible and just wound up tired quite honestly. If I had that day to do over we would have slowed down quite a bit. If you are taking a child even a five year old, take a stroller it really saved us that day. \n\n\nDay Two was spent mostly in the California adventure park which is a really cool area. We rode the rides we could, had a great lunch at Ariels Grotto, collected more photos and autographs from princesses that we started in a photo and autograph book later in day 1 and saw the frozen show at the hyperion which was probably the thing that made my daughters eyes the widest with wonder through the entire trip.\n\n\nDay three was started with the idea to find the last three princesses needed to finish off her princess autograph book. We used the app to locate and get in line for Rapunzel so that went well. Much to my daughters joy Flynn was accompanying Rapunzel today. Next we found found Princess Tiana at the river boat and she was the such a gracious lady. We were technically too late to get her autograph and picture but she was nice enough to sign my daughters book and even let my daughter walk and talk with her as she exited the area. \n\n\nThis left Merida. Oh my God, we searched everywhere, asked every character information person we could all with no luck. we spent some time in toontown  which was probably my daughters favorite area and she got to ride her first roller coaster there which was awesome. After that we decided to call it a day. Rain was imminent and we were all fairly tired after three long days. My daughter wanted to ride Dumbo one more time and low and behold \nMerida\n walked past. I tried to at least get her to sign my daughters book but apparently she had bears to chase or something and that didn't happen. That was really the only down side to the three days. As we left, I got a nice picture of the    \nCastle\n. \n\n\nOverall, it was an incredible three days. My daughter had a great time and has memories I don't think she'll forget for quite some time. It was wonderful to see the magic and wonderment in her eyes and it looks like we may try and do something more Disney next year. If any of you find Merida, kick her in the shins for me!!!!!",

I was wearing a Batman hoodie, and the security CM on the way in stopped me and went, \"You're not allowed in here!\" ...which led into a short debate with him and two other CMs over Batman versus Iron Man. We agreed that Ben Affleck is an okay Batman, but we're interested to see him in more movies. \n\n\nI saw the newsboys' show, which never fails to make me happy, and then headed over to Disneyland, but as I was going down Buena Vista St there was a cast member calling \"free jokes!\" so...

There are some things that I wish Disney could do better while managing the massive amount of people in their parks. Here are some of my suggestions.\n\n\n\n\nNo parades! The absolute worst thing is when you're trying to get somewhere with the already terrible crowds and then suddenly a parade starts. Its impossible to get across Main Street and it overall is just a mess. I understand parades are \"part of the magic\" but It could actually be dangerous if someone had a gun or something.\n\n\n\n\nPark Limits. The parks need to have lower crowd limits. I feel that if you can't walk 5 feet without bumping into someone, the park is too crowded. As I said before, not only does it ruin the experience, it could potentially be dangerous.\n\n\n\n\nTicket prices. This is pretty controversial, but I feel that Disney should up their ticket prices. It reduces the crowds and makes them more money in the process. I understand some people wouldn't be able to afford it, but that is kind of the point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI really miss being able to walk around freely without loosing your party. Now it goes from barely manageable to completely unbearable. What do you think Disney could do to fix their crowds?\n\n\nEdit: For everyone saing \"they wouldn't have a gun. that's what security is for\" I understand but that was not the main point. If anything dangerous were to happen it would be very very difficult to get out. Even if they opened backstage it would be a complete mad house. The gun was just an example.",

If you don't know he leads the most technologically advanced nation  on the planet, Wakanda. So I thought hey, depending on how successful the film is, and how fleshed out Wakanda is. There is some attraction material there. I thought about it and said that Tommorowland would be the best spot as it fits the theme of futuristic, utopian setting. People will say Animal Kingdom is better but because of rights issues Disney can't make Marvel attractions in Orlando. So my question is if this were to happen.

  "title":"Let's talk about Frontierland",
  "text":"I feel like Frontierland is the least-talked about area of the park on this sub. In some ways, this is a good thing; when we talk about Critter Country, Toon Town, or Tomorrowland, it's usually to lament the state of the theming\/rides\/general upkeep. On the other hand, Frontierland doesn't get nearly the same love as Main Street or New Orleans Square.\n\n\nFrontierland is interesting, I think, because it's one of the lands least affected by IPs. It's not a huge land, but essentially everything is an original concept. The exceptions of course are the riverboat and Tom Sawyer Island. Disney has adapted several Mark Twain stories over the years, but never into an animated film, which leaves these areas feeling less commercialized than, say, Fantasyland, where nearly every ride features characters from the animated films.\n\n\nI think the other reason we don't talk about Frontierland too often is that the theming is not only well done, but also self-sustaining. Unlike other areas of the park, wear and tear in Frontierland fits the Wild West aesthetic, so things like fading paint and dirt don't take away from the experience. This is in direct contrast with areas like Tomorrowland and Toon Town, which have to be constantly refurbished and yet often feel lackluster.\n\n\nFrontierland has undergone changes just like any other area of the park. Some people were upset to lose Big Thunder Ranch and the petting zoo, but for the most part people seem pretty content with the area the way it is. I'm curious to hear what you guys think: Is Frontierland perfect as is? Is there anything you'd bring back? Any changes\/expansions you'd like to see? Do you think Disney will inject more IPs into the space in the years to come? How could we incorporate some of the things that make Frontierland so successful into other\/new areas of the park?",

I see now they're all closed. \ud83d\ude14 They weren't listed as going to be under refurbishment when I booked end of November\/early December or we might have selected a different month.\n\n\nThat being said- Anyone have good recommendations for rides my kiddo and 2 adults can ride and enjoy? We plan on babywearing (though I don't know if you can do that on the rides?), he's a super chill baby that doesn't startle easily or cry at much of anything (so dark rides are okay). \n\n\nShould we also bring a little umbrella stroller?

  "title":"Crowd Complaints",
  "text":"I was reading Facebook reviews about Disneyland and realized that not everyone hates crowds. In fact, an overwhelming majority of the reviews don't mention crowds at all. This, in the complaint-addled FB\/social media\/entitled-net. The exaggerations are pretty funny too (only getting to ride 4 rides all day, etc.). \n\n\nI understand that for some, crowds are annoying. Some people even have legitimate anxiety in crowds. I think that is inherently natural for a small number of people. But as we see throughout the world and history, people are drawn to each other and like the spectacle of it all.\n\n\nOne major assumption that I see frequently is that \"Disney is raising ticket prices to reduce crowds.\" No, Disney is raising prices to make more money as they are obligated to do as a publicly traded company. Discounts and promotions may help attract more guests but the inverse is not necessarily true especially in a very wealthy Southern Californian market. Regular vs Peak ticket pricing should be seen as more of a discount than a deterrent.\n\n\nThere is a breaking point however where guests do not report being satisfied with the amount of attractions they get to experience during their day. Judging by the 898k 5 star reviews on FB (versus 65k 1-star reviews), they are far from getting to the point where a significant number people find the crowds inhibiting.\n\n\nMy point is that for every person you hear grumbling about crowds and waits, there are 9 others that are having a great time just being in the Parks. Not everyone hates crowds and if you could just walk on to every ride, would you truly appreciate them as much? Disney Parks nerds are the exception as we could be perfectly happy riding all the rides over and over again. Most guests talk about \"finishing\" Parks in their reviews (esp DCA) but I'm never finished.\n\n\nStar Wars Land is going to push Disneyland past its limit and I believe they will eventually have to raise AP prices to $1500 and stop selling new APs (renew only). The park may have to frequently phase close and day guests will have to book date-specific tickets. My hope is that they will not over-pack the park (add 5-6k capacity) as the walkways, dining, and restroom infrastructure cannot handle peak crowds as is right now.",

People were booted off the curb on Main Street, too.\n\n\nThe castmembers told me this is a new policy they found out about Tuesday morning. It was started to keep the walkways clear for all the foot traffic. And to prevent the hordes of people saving seats 3 hours before a parade starts.\n\n\nI had a large group of family with me - 12 of us! - and the castmember told me we had to move around the area if we wanted to guarantee seats.

I also love writing and talking about Disney so I'm going to apologize now for a long post.\n\n\nMy birthday was yesterday, March 4th, and there were only 3 things I wanted. The gray stuff, a Pimm's Punch from Carthay, and to see the MSEP. \n\n\nRed Rose Tavern opens at 11am, and I had originally planned on getting in line around 10am. Well, we got there at 945am and saw that the line was already ~60 people long, so we got in line. By the time it was 10:50 the line was already at Snow White's Scary Adventures, even after the cast members made announcements that they didn't have the rose cup. \n\n\nIt opened at 11am and we got our food and sat down by 11:20. I got the poutine flatbread, my husband got Beast's Burger, we each got the gray stuff, and Gaston's Brew. Now, despite only waiting in line for that long for the Gray Stuff, my favorite thing ended up being the brew. It was delicious, an apple-mango drink with passion fruit foam. \n\n\nI actually ended up liking the Gray Stuff from WDW more, and was a little underwhelmed with everything else from Red Rose. Still, I'm happy that I waited and tried everything. I'm not sure if the wait ended up being any shorter throughout the day, but it was a crazy busy day so I wouldn't be surprised if they ended up selling out of the gray stuff. As we were leaving around noon the line was still fairly long. \n\n\nAlso FreshBakedDisney was right behind me as I was waiting in line and I internally freaked out a little and they definitely made my birthday a little more magical. \n\n\nDespite it being a busy day, we still rode all of our favorite rides, took a nap at our hotel, had dinner at Carthay and enjoyed the MSEP. \n\n\nIf you want to see the parade and you're going on a weekend, I 100% recommend getting a dining package. About 30 minutes before the first show started they made an announcement that all of the viewing areas were full. My husband and I were able to get an awesome viewing spot in the reserved spot for Aladdin's Oasis about 20 minutes before it started.\n\n\nMy final thoughts? Gaston's Brew would be amazing with rum and I really can't wait for Paint the Night to return.",

It now looks more like a waterfall. \n\n\nThere are clouds and the moon now being projected on the back wall of the room with the ship Cannon battle.

We won't be riding any of the \"big rides\" and this will be a totally kid-focused trip. \n\n\nWe are planning to get to the parking garage an hour before opening. No magic morning that morning. Wednesday. We will buy our tickets in advance and get to the rope ASAP. \n\n\nOur plan so far is to book it (8:00) to Peter Pan, do Alice, Dumbo, and whatever else in Fantasyland, then head straight to Mickey's House when ToonTown opens (9:00). Then we will see the rest of ToonTown. We will probably hit Small World on the way out of there. \n\n\nSo, what next? Take a break? Head to Tomorrowland or Adventureland? \n\n\nPirates and Haunted Mansion are two of our favorite rides, but I'm guessing my boys will love Autopia and Buzz, too. Also wondering when might be the best time to take a lunch\/afternoon break?\n\n\nLastly, we will definitely want to watch the fireworks, but I can't remember how everything happens at that time. What gets shut down? Should we hunker down or watch from ride lines? Best places to position ourselves?\n\n\nAnd what about the Electrical Parade? If we do that, should it be the show before or after the fireworks?\n\n\nSummary questions:\n\n\n\n\nIf we do Fantasyland and ToonTown first, should we go to the right side or left side of the park next?\n\n\n\n\nGiven our planned itinerary, when should we take a lunch\/afternoon break?\n\n\n\n\nCan you give me the rundown on Fireworks? \n\n\n\n\nShould we go to the first or second Electrical Parade? \n\n\n\n\nCan you tell me about Fantasy Faire?

(For those who don't know) there are two sections before the ride actually gets going: 1) the loading area 2) the seatbelt check.  So I get in, place my bag in the compartment, and put on my seatbelt.  This girl to my right is looking for her seatbelt and calmly asking herself\/family \"where's my seatbelt?\"  She's a first timer for sure because as soon as the Jeep started moving she freaked out and started yelling in a concerned manner \"I don't have a seatbelt!\"  She looks to find the nearest CM, waves her arms about frantically \"Ma'am!  Ma'am!  stop the ride!  I don't have a seatbelt!\"  Her mom jumps in with similar pleas for help, \"She doesn't have a seatbelt!!\"  The Jeep stops in front of the CM who, unbeknowest to the girl and her family, does the final seatbelt check.  The CM calmly states that \"the seatbelt is on your right hand side.\"  At this point I ask the girl to sit forward so I can reach behind her to help find her seatbelt.  At first i couldn't find it either.  Then i felt the strap.  Her brother (to her right) had taken her seatbelt and strapped himself in the whole time.  I explained to the CM who manually turned off the buckle safety so everyone could buckle in correctly.  The CM then proceeded to do her standard check and sent us on our merry way.  As we departed the station, the father says \"well, at least they check everyone.\"  (This was at 11pm after I'm sure a full day of them going on other rides where seatbelt\/safety checks are standard before ride departure).",

During the 3:30 frozen performance they stopped the show about 10 minutes in because of technical difficulties, got started back up after a bit of delay. California Screaming was down right after the frozen performance.\n\n\nSo that all together is already an unfortunate day ride wise, especially with TOT closed. But then the icing to it all? World of Color malfunctioned half way through and they cancelled! \n\n\nFor the size crowd it was definitely a rough one for Disney. My wife and I still managed to have a blast as always, but it was a unique Disney day for sure.",

I've been to Disneyland a ton of times, but it's always been for summer vacation. I've always wanted to go for Christmas so I'm incredibly excited, but I just had a few questions to ask...\n\n\n1- is the park absolutely insane the third week of December? My fiancee's PHD program doesn't let out until Dec 15th, so I was thinking for our part of the trip we might fly out on the 15th and spend the 16th-18th in the park and fly back on the 19th... is that a terrible plan? We don't mind the park being busy as we're used to being there in August, but I was there for the last day of the 60th Anniversary Celebration so I have a new idea as to what \"too packed\" actually looks like.\n\n\n2 - What fun Christmas stuff can we look forward to? :) I've been following Micechat on and off and noticed the little egg hunt they put on for Easter... I know the Haunted Mansion turns over into Nightmare Before Christmas, but what else should I start getting excited for? More ride theme changes? Fun foods? Fun shows?\n\n\nThanks all :)",

  "text":"So we decided to do something fun for our 2.5 year old for Easter this year. When he was about 1 we took him with some family friends to the Plaza Inn and he had fun eating and seeing all of the characters. We had talked to a cast member who said occasionally characters like Stitch would be at Goofy's Kitchen in the Disneyland Hotel. We're pretty disappointed. \n\n\nThe experience consists of a fairly basic buffet style breakfast with the Disney characters going around from table to table and eventually getting together while music is playing for a miniparade through the joint. Today there were half the number of characters that there when we did the same thing a year ago at the Plaza Inn. The \"parade\" while we were there was almost comically bad. I say this as it consisted if Pluto skipping through the room by himself. Just as the music was ending Minnie showed up in the doorway and stood there swinging her napkin around. \n\n\nAwesome parade guys. \/s. \n\n\nOk well not everybody has a stellar day and the munchkin wasn't expecting the characters so he had fun. On the way out however is when my real disappointment hits. My toddler being excited about going on a ride in the main park was skipping out and does a sudden face plant onto an obviously dirty floor in a higj traffic area at the entrance. As we pick him up our feet stick to the floor as well. Its one thing for a toddler to fall, afterall, they bounce. Its another for it to be so dirty that he can't recover and leaves with his first bloody nose. It isn't too bad and he seems ok however this is certainly not the kind of experience that we expect for this price, and even more so from a Disney property.\n\n\nTLDR; Easter Brunch at Goofy's kitchen ended with a bloody nose for the 2 year old.",

I'm trying to help them save for a toy or whatever they'd like, so I'm making a chart with some pictures of examples of what they can get (for $5, $10, $20, up to $50). I've looked around online but I haven't been able to find any definitive price guide (other than for shirts and mouse ears and such). I'm more curious about plushies, lightsabers, figurines, etc. Any help you could offer would be great!",

  "text":"I'm leaning toward the answer of \"no\", but it's worth a shot to ask! \n\n\nMy family (3 of us) will be going to Disneyland in a few weeks. The very last day we are there is the day Indiana Jones reopens. It is our last day in the hotel, so we will need to pack up in the morning, resulting in us not being able to get into the park as early as we'd like. Ideally, we go early and run to Indy to get fast passes because I know the line will be crazy all day, but it is not feasible. What my question is, is this: if we have 4-day fast passes, will my bf be able to go into the park at opening and get fast passes for all three of us even if two of us are not there? Or do the machines know that the ticket has not been activated for that particular day? I considered the idea of posting here offering money for them as it is my favorite ride, but he said no one would probably bite lol. Advice is welcome! Thank you!",

And yes, some of that can be put on high crowd levels in the park and it just reopening after a lengthy refurb, but still, it has just felt so chaotic in that area. \n\n\nAnd I blame Fastpass for a lot of it! Just mounds of people in the area and the FP line itself being almost 20 min long, with a CM needed at the end to direct people into it.\n\n\nNow, I'm not saying do away with Matterhorn FP entirely. I think FP is awesome in general, and I use it all the time. But I think Disney needs to reevaluate how many FPs they give out for Matterhorn. At around noon today, consider two of the top rides (excluding Splash because it was rainy today so lower waits and Indy is down for refurb):\n\n\n-Space Mountain, 60 min wait, FP return time 8:55\n\n\n-Matterhorn, 85 min wait, FP return 1:30!\n\n\nThere is no reason why a ride with that long of a wait should have a FP return time that soon. Consider if they lessened the amount of FPs per hour. That would mean later return times, which could push people into the Standby line. But then the FP line would be smaller and more manageable, allowing more standby people on the ride. \n\n\nI just feel like right now it's not safe or enjoyable from a crowd management point of view.",

  "title":"Anyone else wish Disneyland would turn back time a bit &amp; limit admission to allow for a better experience when we visit?",
  "text":"Let me start by saying, I love Disneyland & I wish I could go there everyday. If I could afford it I'd visit daily & live stream my endeavors too. \n\n\nNow, that being said, I remember going to Disneyland in the early 90's & being able to walk around the park without having to dodge other people at every step. A day when you could actually see the road somewhat down Main Street as you make your way to the hub; where you'd excitedly choose the direction of your first step towards the land where your visit will begin. \nPlus, as a huge bonus, wait times were generally 15 minutes for most rides & the major attractions topped out at 1 hour. \n\n\nI'm not complaining about the park(s) as they stand today & I am one of the biggest Disneyland fanatics you could ever meet, but over the last 7 years or more I would have to say that I have been rather disappointed & annoyed with the crowds & wait times when I visit.  I've gotten to the point where I find myself walking around the park or strolling through the shops rather than going on rides because I don't want to have to stand in 40 minute lines for Pirates or an hour or longer for most any other ride. Some are so out of control that I don't even consider them unless it's closing time because then they are normally decent, but also time is extremely limited. \n\n\nI don't want to skip the rides or feel like I'm on bumper cars just walking around the parks & I know I'm not alone. Don't even get me started on the parade crowds & ridiculous detours for them that pin you into certain areas of the park temporarily. Anyone who feels the same & would love to truly enjoy the parks as they should be able to when you visit please up vote this post & respond. I want to hear from you & I invite you to share any other frustrations you may have with the parks that we all love so much as well. \n\n\nThank you for reading & I hope to hear from you all soon.",

At first it was very surreal; an almost a rude encounter. In my experience, a grown man referring to a grown woman as Princess is probably the height of rudeness, it's basically condescendingly mocking someone for thinking they're better than you. Then it happened again and again, at least 3 or 4 more times throughout the span of several days, and we figured this was just something they are told to do for the sake of ambiance. It became somewhat funny at that point, as we wondered if they were all just secretly making fun of people, or if more likely this is just something in their job description.\n\n\nI was wondering if anyone knew if this is something that is specifically outlined for CM's. Is it something they do for little girls that they have just extended to adult women as well?

  "text":"This is just me being curious but the wife and I Saw two separate incidents in about  a week of each other. The first was maybelast weekend(?) there was a woman yelling at police who were near the hotel about a hundred feet from the security check point by ESPN. She was rambling on about Uber and contacting her husband, she was then handcuffed and put into the cruiser though not too willingly.\n\n\nThe other incident was tonight. In the adjacent parking lot to the hotel (on the walk to the structure) we hear a loud scream of what I thought was a girl but may have been a woman. We look and there is a cop car there as well as a vehicle with its hood open.  The w Man screams something like \"Make it stop make it stop\" but I can understand much more.\n\n\nWas wondering if anyone knew what this was about? Our thoughts were probably drug and\/or alcohol related but not sure. Just being mosey and perhaps a bit concerned over stuff going down at the resort.",

I'm looking to do one of the dinning packages for World of Color and I'd like your opinion of which one I should do. I've gone to Ariel's Grotto the last 2-3 times I've been and I think I've been to Wine Country Trattoria once (it's been years and I don't remember much). I've heard lots of amazing things from Carthay Circle but never have been.\n\n\nMy original plan is Ariel's Grotto because that's just what I've done in the past. Thoughts?\n\n\nAlso, there are 3 of us going for sure, but possibly a 4th person, should I make the reservation for 3? or 4?",

But I'm concerned about Disneyland in particular and would like to go on what is estimated to be the least busy day out of those so we can experience as much as possible. \n\n\nI figured I'd ask here because there are more experienced Disney-goers than myself here, but out of those days which would be the best option for our day in Disneyland?

First  thing I did was go to get in line and CMs said that they were waiting until the day guests had emptied out and to come back later.  Then later the CM directing the line advised us to come back later when the line would be shorter.  *Finally* we got in line (which at the start was literally just a switchback taped on the ground) and it was insanity.  There was zero crowd control which led to widespread cutting even inside the proper queue.  People were unlinking the chains and cutting off entire sections of people waiting.  The only time everyone calmed down was when the line stopped moving due to technical difficulties.  After about 20 minutes they announced that it would be a 2 hour wait for the ride, that&#039;s when I left and went shopping.  Guess I&#039;ll ride Guardians some other time.

Since I can't actually book anything yet, because I'm waiting for better sales on most everything, I am posting here so that I can get rid of some of my Disney madness. \n\n\nSo I am requesting some ride suggestions. I have been to Disneyland a few times in my life, so I know a lot of rides I like, but there are some that I probably would like but just haven't given a shot yet. Here are some rides that I really like: Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean, Star Tours, Thunder Mountain, and the Matterhorn. I have been on the Haunted Mansion and It's a Small World and they are okay, but aren't my favorite (I know Haunted mansion is beloved, but I'm just not a big fan of spooky, halloweeny things). In California Adventure I really like California Screamin', Tower of Terror (not a fan of the atmosphere, but it is a super fun ride, I'm really excited for Mission Breakout), Mickey's Fun Wheel, Grizzly River Rapids, and Soarin'. \n\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions for rides that you really like and think we should try out, please let me know! We are going for 5(!) days this time so we will have time to try new things instead of just making sure we get all the classics we love in. Thanks!\n\n\nOh, and I will also take any suggestions for any treats or food you would recommend trying out. We will make sure to get Dole Whips.",

  "text":"I was looking at the numbers for the Disneyland Railroad with the re-opening coming up soon (hopefully). Very exciting! There have been rumors that the testing for safety timing will be ongoing and that many people are going to want to ride. This is worrisome if not all 4 trains will be running when the DLRR is in highest demand.\n\n\nThe highest capacity rolling stock are the Excursion with 325 passengers. If that is the only train in operation, it seems like the train will only be able to complete 2.73 circuits per hour (22 minute round trip). That\u2019s 887\/hr. capacity or about the same as the Submarines. I imagine the Toontown Station being the only operating station as Main St doesn't have ADA access and NOS is congested with HM and PotC traffic. Also, it\u2019s \u201cgood show\u201d to have the new section be the finale. If the train doesn't have to stop at other stations, it may be able to complete the circuit in 15 mins(?) which is 1,300\/hr, about the same as Pooh. 1,300 \u2022 16 hr operating day = 20,800. With TEA 2016 attendance numbers at 17,943,000 is an average of 49,149 a day. 42% of park attendees will get to ride.\n\n\nIf they can run 2 trains, the Excursion (325 passengers) and the Holiday Red (264 passengers) rolling stock will hold 589 passengers. Stopping only at one station, the capacity will be 1,362\/hr. (avg 294.5 \u2022 5.46 dispatches per hr.) about the same capacity as Jungle Cruise. 1,362 \u2022 16 hr day = 21,729 or 44% daily avg att.\n\n\nWhen all 4 trains run they can hold 1,014 passengers. If all passengers rode across the park (2 stops: Main St - Toontown, NOS - Tomorrowland), it would be 1,014 \u2022 every 2 stops \u2022 2.73 circuits\/hr = 5,536\/hr. \u2022 16 hr day = 88,583 or 180% avg daily att.\n\n\nThe Unofficial Guide has observed 8 mins per 100 people in line per station (750 \u2022 4 stations). That is a practical capacity of 3,000\/hr still higher than any other ride in DLR. 48,000\/day or 98% avg daily att.\n\n\nAmazingly, if everyone only rode one stop and got off and the trains were filled completely, the DLRR would have a capacity of 11,072\/hr. More than all the Mountain rides in Disneyland combined! 177,166 passengers per day or everyone getting to ride 3.6 times. \n\n\nSources: Wikipedia, TEA 2016, Touring Plans Unofficial Guide\n\n\nEdit: formatting multiplication to \u2022",

I'm really hoping for that so we can take our toddler back to our hotel for an afternoon nap, then come back to the park again. Also is the $20 pass the only option available, or is there such thing as a 5 day parking pass to go along with the 5 day park hopper pass?\n\n\n2- I found out that we don't have to pay for our 2 1\/2 year old to enter the park. Does he still need to get some kind of pass so he's known as a registered guest? Or does he just come in the park with us with ID?\n\n\n3- We're expecting another little person in the near future. Is there any idea for a Disney themed gender reveal while we're at the park?\n\n\n4- What's a favourite place for dining with a toddler? \n\n\nThanks to everyone in advance, for your answers and suggestions.

It seems nuts - but I'm on my own, so can take advantage of single rider lines, I also visited Tokyo Disneyland (and Disney Sea) a few weeks ago so I'll be happy if I'm able to hit Matterhorn, Jungle Cruise, Space Mountain and Star Tours at Disneyland and Screaming', Soarin' and Radiator Spring Racers and ofcourse Mission Breakout at DCA.\n\n\nI know this will be super expensive and busy - but is it slightly realistic?\n\n\nThanks!",

  "title":"Disneyland Dilemma",
  "text":"Hey everyone! So I am planning a weeklong trip (5 park days) to Disneyland first week of February with just my husband. However, I started thinking about how I've never been to Disneyland around Christmas time and I've always wanted to go that time of year. I decided to check out airline and hotel prices just to see (I figured it would be a lot more expensive to go in December) and found to my surprise that airline and hotel prices aren't that much higher (like 150 more total for both). I was looking at going the second week on December, leaving Dec 8th and coming back the 14th or 15th. \n\n\nI am conflicted now. Going in December means seeing Disneyland in all it's Christmas splendor, which I have always wanted to see. It also means that I am not taking time off of school to go. However, going in February means less crowds, a little cheaper, and more time to save for the trip. \n\n\nIs it worth the crowds to see Disneyland at Christmas time? How bad are the crowds during that second week on December? According to crowd calandars I've looked at, it doesn't seem super bad except maybe that saturday. Like medium crowd levels, which I think would be okay for us.  \n\n\nI could save some money but cutting the trip from 8 days (2 travel days and a breather day) to 7. In your opinions, is it worth the money spent for an extra day to give us a day in the middle to relax? The airfare alone would save us 40 bucks to go back a day sooner, plus hotel and food savings.\n\n\nSorry for the long post! Any advice would be appreciated. Also sorry for any mistakes\/clunky formatting. I am on mobile.",

  "title":"Theory: Hollywood Tower Hotel Will Probably Return (Eventually)",
  "text":"Sitting in the theater yesterday seeing Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, there was a DCA advertisement for the new GoTG ride, which got me thinking about the park's long-term future in terms of attractions and rides. All in all, I liked the Tower of Terror a lot, and was disappointed with the replacement, however I understand the desire to make changes to the park, and capitalize on new IP's in the parks.\n\n\nDespite this, me and several friends were talking about this and we all came to a similar conclusion that given the quick conversion of the ToT to GoTG, it seems very likely that this simple re-skinning has a more practical purpose; The ride will probably be converted back to the ToT in the future, particularly once the appeal of the GoTG overlay fizzles out. Obviously this is something I am sure Disney Parks will remain flexible on, making a change dependent on the lifespan of interest in the new ride, but I simply do not see this reskin as the end of this story. Simply put, GoTG probably doesn't have the staying power of a classic ride, and once the movie franchise eventually concludes, it seems doubtful that they would keep this ride as-is forever.\n\n\nCue in some eventual point down the road, maybe 10 or 15 years from now, where they remove the overlay and redo the decor very cheaply and quickly given that they still have most of the old items, and can make a big press announcement and generate a ton of buzz, make new merchandise, and announce the return of the Tower of Terror.\n\n\nI not only consider this possible, I feel it is almost certain to happen some time down the road. So for those who miss the Tower of Terror: fret not, because it will probably be coming back someday.\n\n\nAnyways, not sure what anyone else thinks of this idea, or if anyone else has thought the same thing.",

  "title":"DCA Name Change",
  "text":"It was hinted at that Disney's Hollywood Studios is getting yet another name change. Also, there are rumors out that Disney California Adventure will also get another name change. Yes, another. It used to be called Disney's California Adventure but was quietly changed to Disney California Adventure in 2012. I speculate that the name may actually be changed to \nDisney Adventures Florida\n and \nDisney Adventures California\n.\n\n\nSimplicity\nCasual guests call DCA \"California Adventures\" or just \"California.\" It's the same way at WDW where a simple name works better than a multi-syllabic one. You hardly hear people say Walt Disney World  (4 syllables) as \"WDW\" (7 syllables!). They usually just call the parks by a nickname like \"DHS\" \"MGM\" or \"Studios.\" DAC guests may still just call it \"Disney Adventures\" or \"California.\"\n\n\nTheme\nGuardians and Marvel have really disrupted the idea of a unified \"Californian\" theme for some people (ahem, ToT fans). Yes, there is a Hollywood in CA but it can be said that a lot of the 2.0 changes to the park have been outside of the CA theme such as Cars (Arizona), Little Mermaid (Danish?), Monsters (Monstropolis), and Soarin' (world). DCA to DAC suggests that it's an Adventure park in California. Californian themed areas are fine. Adventures are central theme.\n\n\nStudios \u2260 Theme Parks\nIt is time Disney abandons all fake studio settings in its parks. MGM Studios was a rush job to get ahead of Universal Orlando. It was not born out of a real strength of Disney's and mainly just used to crush its competition. Even more of an insult, DCA adopted the poorly themed backlot setting in its Hollywood section. Sorry, but the Hyperion Theater is an eyesore from the sides. Nothing about it draws guests down the street. The Backlot section is a hot mess. Un-themed show buildings and exposed structural elements do nothing for immersion. Guests want to be in these worlds not \"learn\" how they are made. And theme park geeks already know. Just like: most people like to eat hot dogs but they don't want to see how they're made.\n\n\nBrand Unification, Differentiated\nNow there are some rumors that Disney wants DHS and DCA to have the same name for branding. I think is somewhat of a good approach. Hearing about \"going to Disney\" is a thing no matter if it's DLR or WDW. I can imagine a lot of hype generated in the news about new stuff at the \"Disney Adventures park\" and it being applicable to both coasts. Adding California and Florida will be a differentiation and could still work for both.\n\n\nWill anyone really notice? Even the most hardcore Disney fans still say \"Disney's California Adventure\" (I'm looking at you, YouTubers) so perhaps people won't even adopt the change. Still, DAC better fits the direction of the park and doesn't shake up its nicknames too much. \"California Adventures\" is still a suitable nickname for Disney Adventures California. I hear people say \"DAC\" sometimes anyway.",

( not sure if that's a good time to go) or if I should wait until the spring of next year? \n\n\nTL:DR - Mom always wanted to take me to Disneyland, only making it half way there herself, as a kid. I'm able\/wanting to take her soon and need help in booking\/deciding on a hotel close by. \n\n\nThank you very much for any and all help!",

Currently we were planing on one day at Disneyland and one day at DCA. As I research more I wonder if we really need a full day at DCA. We love the newness of it all, but we will save some time since we aren't big on rollercoasters. \n\n\nDoes it make more sense to get a park hopper for the DCA day so we can spend the evening at Disneyland (and can we get one park hopper day, and one not? or do you just buy a park hopper for your trip overall?) or stick with the one park per day plan?\n\n\nThoughts from anyone who has grappled with this is appreciated!",

Are there any tips and tricks to getting better deals? Would calling a hotel directly and asking to book through a hotel employee work out better as opposed to trying to book through one of the many hotel finding websites? What kinds of discounts tend to give the best price cuts? (I have AAA, at the very least)     \n\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

My current g\/f asked me to go to Disneyland with her three years ago, and I obliged. I didn't realize just how much of a fantastic day it would be, but it was.\n\n\nIt brought back so many memories as a kid. I vividly remembered being at Disneyland as a kid. It was this escape that I was gifted by a friends parents and a trip with my Grandparents on a separate occasion. \n\n\nI grew up in a not so nuclear family as a kid so Disneyland was a place where I could finally be a kid. I didn't have much of a childhood growing up so when I went to Disneyland it really allowed me to forget about all the hardships that were back at home.\n\n\nAs an adult I now realize just what a magical place it can be for many. Sure it's easy to lose your cool over strollers, people standing in pathways, walking against the flow of traffic, etc. but at the end of the day none of that really matters. \n\n\nI wonder if Walt knew he was creating a place for those who were less fortunate in a way. Disneyland is my new hobby, and I don't feel bad or embarrassed about that one bit.haha\n\n\nI fondly remember the Electrical Parade with my Grandparents. They have since passed away unfortunately. Seeing the electrical parade again really got to me, and spawned this question.\n\n\nI am now on the fence about purchasing a single light bulb from the electrical parade for far too much money.haha",

We are staying at the Disneyland Hotel for two nights, Friday and Saturday, and did not get Park Hoppers but are open to upgrading. \n\n\nAny tips for maximizing our time are greatly appreciated, and I'd also love input on the best snacks to try.

Also, what should I order at Trader Sam's?!\n\n\nDay 1 - Friday 9\/22\n\n\n\n\n8am Drop bags at hotel early, head to DCA because Disneyland has Mickey's Halloween Party this night.\n\n\n\n\nGet a FastPass for GoG. Use MaxPass to get a Racers FastPass after. What land should we go to first to maximize the early hours?\n\n\n\n\n12pm Lunch will probably be a bunch of snacks between Cozy Cone, corn dogs, churros, etc. unless there's a restaurant you'd recommend? Prioritize FastPasses for California Screamin' and Soarin'.\n\n\n\n\n4pm Lobster nachos + drinks at Cove Bar!\n\n\n\n\n7pm ADR at Wine Country Trattoria and drinks at Carthay Circle Lounge (I'm vegetarian and dinner at Carthay Circle just doesn't seem worth it but I may be wrong.)\n\n\n\n\nTBD World of Color. Does anyone know what time this usually runs after Labor Day?\n\n\n\n\nTrader Sam's-- this may be the thing I'm most excited about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 2 - Saturday 9\/23\n\n\n\n\n8am Head to Disneyland and start in Fantasyland. Use MaxPass to get an Indiana Jones FastPass. \n\n\n\n\n10am Grab breakfast at Jolly Holiday. Prioritize FastPasses for Space Mountain and Haunted Mansion (because Halloween). \n\n\n\n\n12pm Lunch at Rancho del Zocalo\n\n\n\n\n7pm Paint the Night.

  "title":"the cost to get every Smashed Coin in DL",
  "text":"I had seen an archived question from a year ago asking about the cost to collect every smashed coin in Disneyland. No one had an exact answer, merely estimations of $50 or so. Naturally, I decided to go through my smashed coin collection from late 2015 (part of the Diamond Anniversary 60th celebration) and answer the question as thoroughly as possible for my own sake and everyone else. I'm very analytical, so my calculations will be very in-depth and specific because there are a lot of variables to take into account. The short answer is when I got every single smashed coin from the 60th Celebration it cost me \n$80.64 for 138 smashed coins\n.\n\n\nHere's the basic formulas to start out:\nSmashed pennies cost $0.51 (two quarters and the penny)\nSmashed quarters cost $1.00 (four quarters, one of which will be pressed)\nSmashed dimes cost $0.85 (three quarters and the dime)\nSmashed nickels cost $0.80 (three quarters and the nickel)\n\n\nIf you were going to both Disneyland and California Adventure parks, Downtown Disney, and go inside all the Disneyland Resorts, and if the special Diamond Celebration coins were still there, this is your total cost: \n$80.64 with 138 smashed coins\n (114 pennies, 15 quarters, 6 dimes, and 3 nickels). The Diamond Celebration machines I'm told were replaced and more machines were added, but those special edition coins are no longer available.\n\n\nThe math formula would be:\n\n\n(114x0.51)+(15x1)+(6x0.85)+(3x0.80)=?\n\n\n58.14+15+5.10+2.40=$80.64\n\n\nThis is the most coins you can possibly get as of November, 2015 (again, this includes all the 60th Anniversary coin machines, both parks, Downtown Disney shops, and all hotels). I haven't been back since then, so it has changed. I was informed new Toy Story and Star Wars machines were added in Tomorrowland.\n\n\nNow, here are some more specific breakdowns from my Nov. 2015 expedition:\n\n\n\n\nDisneyland Park w\/60th coins: \nA total of $42.96\n with 51 pennies ($26.01), 12 quarters ($12), 3 dimes ($2.55), and 3 nickels ($2.40).\n\n\n\n\nDisneyland Park w\/o 60th coins: \nA total of $27.78\n with 33 pennies ($16.83), 6 quarters ($6), 3 dimes ($2.55), and 3 nickels ($2.40).\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Advenutre Park w\/60th coins: \nA total of $25.44\n with 39 pennies ($19.89), 3 quarters ($3), and 3 dimes ($2.55).\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Adventure Park w\/o 60th coins: \nA total of $20.85\n with 30 pennies ($15.30), 3 quarters ($3), and 3 dimes ($2.55).\n\n\n\n\nDowntown Disney Stores and Disneyland Resort Hotels w\/60th coins: \nA total of $12.24\n with 24 pennies.\n\n\n\n\nDowntown Disney Stores and Disneyland Resort Hotels w\/60th coins: \nA total of $9.18\n with 18 pennies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile I'm fairly certain my calculations are correct, I might have made some mistakes. But at least now you should have a better gauge of how much you'll be spending on these small collectibles. Hope this helps someone!\n\n\n*Update: I revised this post because of information provided in the comments. The biggest piece of information is that the 60th Anniversary machines were replaced, and new ones were added; meaning that my totals are a minimum, not a maximum.",

  "title":"Welcoming back the Disneyland Railroad and Rivers of America",
  "text":"We had an amazing day at Disneyland. We got the park a few minutes after rope drop thanks to some fun traffic. The line for the Disneyland Railroad stretched down the Main St Station stairs and out by entrance tunnel. I was able to run to Market House and grab some coffee and breakfast sandwiches as we waited. It was only about 20-30 mins of waiting however and we barely finished our food before boarding. There was excitement in the air. As the trains loaded and left, guests cheered and clapped. Pure joy. The new Northwest section of track was packed with new scenery. The Rivers of America show elements are nicely incorporated into the DLRR experience. It bridges and waterfalls are nice. I could do without the constant narration and terrible script. The dioramas were extra-magical with projected effects on he backgrounds. We did 2 loops around the park.\n\n\nWe then walked through Big Thunder Trail and explored the new entrances to Star Wars Galaxy's Edge. The rock work is stunning. These will be a nice quiet place to hang out at least until 2019.\n\n\nWe hopped on board of the Mark Twain and got to see the Indian Chief, Settler's Cabin, Shaman, and Indian Village in their new locations. The trip did not seem too much shorter or slower. The again, we didn't have to wait because the Columbia wasn't in service yet.\n\n\nWe rowed the Explorer canoes and got extra time on the river as we waited by the shore for the Columbia to back out of the dock. Having the Rivers be 25% shorter benefits the canoe experience noticeably. We then got on the Columbia and got a nice bow spot. I'm the king of world!\n\n\nWe also really used the heck out of MaxPass. We got a Guardians FP and used it before lunch. Then we went home to rest and do some errands and work. I was able to book Racers and Space Mountain FPs from home. We returned to the parks at 8:00pm and were able to get FP for Buzz Lightyear twice, Thunder Mtn, and Indy through MP because you can book another as soon as you scan in despite what the cool down time says. Normally if we come in late or split our day like this, we can't get FPs did Space or Indy.\n\n\nWe tried the Galatic Grill's new late night menu and it was all actually delicious. We got loaded tots, space-adilla, sweet chicken bites, and french toast sticks. All were very good and I was surprised to finally have something better than meh in Tomorrowland!\n\n\nWe waited at New Orleans Station for the last DLRR train. It was packed. We were able to squeeze everyone on the last time around and when we got to Main Street they announced they would take us on another loop (esp for those who boarded at Tomorrowland). Everyone cheered. So our last loop had no stops! It only took 10 minutes to make the grand circle tour (rather than the usual 25). Guests thanked CM for staying late and proving extra magic. Feels like Disneyland again. Amazing day.\n\n\n15,439 steps, 6.84 miles",

  "title":"Writing this from LAX on a Cell Phone...",
  "text":"You know, I'll be honest with you guys. When I booked this trip, I was frought with a bit of trepidation. \"Is this trip happening too soon after the last one? Am I spreading this too thin?\" and similar thoughts dominated my purview. It had been about 8 months since my last trip, and let me tell you all, the thought that I may not had waited long enough is now completely laughable to me, because this might've been my best trip to Disneyland I have ever had.\n\n\nNow, let me start out by saying that this particular trip was predicated on a promise I had made to myself, that if regular Space Mountain were to ever return, I would stop at nothing to be there. Well, the announcement came, as I'm sure you all were aware, I scrambled and had to move stuff around and borderline grease some palms to get this to work, but I was there, and it was everything I would've ever wanted it to be, and so much more.\n\n\nYou see, upon booking this, I also had it in the back of my mind that I would've loved to see both Mission Breakout! and the Main Street Electrical Parade. The first one I figured would be absolutely swamped the whole time I was out there, and similar worries awaited me when it came to the second. Not only was I laughably wrong on both counts (rode Mission Breakout! 9 times and showed up 10 minutes early over at the viewing area in front of Small World for the best view of any Disney parade I have ever had...though, having said this, I had never made much of a concerted effort before this), I ended up seeing so much more that I could've ever anticipated. Allow me to provide you with a list:\n\n\nSeeing Belle, Beast and Gaston, and actually seeing Belle and Beast ride the carousel; I had no idea they let characters ride with guests anymore\n\n\nThe \"guide dog on duty\" picture spot with Pluto in Grizzly Peak Airfield makes me smile so much; I hope it never leaves\n\n\nSeeing the characters actually wandering around; I guess I had assumed they weren't allowed to do that anymore? Pluto was EVERYWHERE in DCA, Pinocchio and Honest John just kind of showed up out of nowhere, which was amazing...I think I saw more characters I had never seen out and about I had never seen before during this trip than any other\n\n\nHow can I talk about this trip without mentioning the Train and Rivers of America? It was incredible! The conductor was back! The river boats were actually moving! The canoes were there! Disneyland was back and exactly how I remembered it during my first ever trip, and I have to tell you all, I teared up several times this weekend...heck, I'm tearing up now\n\n\nI want to preface this by saying that I will forever miss Tower of Terror dearly and that they should've never gotten rid of it...but if they had to, the replacement we got is pretty darn terrific; the Easter eggs in the queue line alone were incredible (the original yeti from the Matterhorn? Figment? The octopus from Country Bears? I love it), and, is it just me, or is this version longer? Could be wrong on that, but it sure felt that way...in any case, I loved Mission Breakout and thought it was an absolute blast.\n\n\nNow, this leaves me with the confounded Main Street Electrical Parade; growing up, hearing stories and seeing pictures about Disneyland in particular, it almost always stemmed back to this one attraction, for me. My grandparents had a soundtrack record with the music on it, and I cannot tell you how many times I've listened to it...I had the chance to see the parade at World a bit ago, but, honestly? It wouldn't have felt the same; the fact that I got to actually see it in Disneyland is something that's going to stick with me for the rest of my life...is it kind of antiquated compared to Paint the Night? Yes. Is it a bit on the short side? Yeah...but, I don't know, when I heard \"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BOYS AND GIRLS, CHILDREN OF ALL AGES! DISNEYLAND IS PROUD TO PRESENT...\" I absolutely lost it; so much so that a sweet nearby older couple asked me if I was alright...(spoilers: I was)\n\n\nI rode Space Mountain 13 times, which isn't too bad for 3 days, but I tell you what, once would've easily been enough, just to hear that soundtrack again; Space Mountain is one of my favorite things to ever exist, and while we all know it would've been back eventually anyway, it was so nice to see it again\n\n\nOverall, I had no idea how much I needed this trip until now; I might have never set foot in a Disney park until I was an adult, but being there this weekend made me feel like I was 8 years old again, watching those reruns of \"The Wonderful World of Disney\" on the Disney Channel and daydreaming about how cool it'd be to finally visit...\n\n\nTo finally sum this mess up, I enjoyed myself, and I really hope I'm able to get an annual pass again in the future, 6 hour flights be damned (it's worth it)",

  "title":"The queue theming in the Haunted Mansion leaves something to be desired.",
  "text":"The Mansion, on the inside, is one of the best themed attractions in Disneyland. The detail in the Hall of Paintings and in the ride itself is impeccable, especially given its age and time of construction. However, even though the immaculately manicured lawn and punny graves that were placed in the queue are well made and give a sense of the \"goofy but scary\" atmosphere the HM aims for, its simply too simplistic, especially given the amount of time one spends in the queue.\n\n\nThe Florida Haunted Mansion has interactive elements in the queue to keep guests entertained and to further enhance the theming, pulling us out of the real world and into the Mansion's. I know Florida's HM was made much later and with much more space and resources than the DLR's, but I do think there is room for improvement. Here are some ideas I've come up with to make the theming in the HM queue more effective, borrowing ideas from other rides and attractions that have well-done queue theming. \n\n\n\n\nMaybe play some creepy music throughout the queue, or at least have the Mansion emit some screams and creaks now and again, to display the \"Haunted\" part of the Haunted Mansion. As of now, the Mansion feels like it just sits there, with not a hint of the spooky spectres and grinning ghosts it hosts. Heck, even the Fastpass statue garden has unsettling music box-esque backing music and interesting statues.\n\n\n\n\nMaybe isolate the guests in the queue from the street outside, to better place guests in the Mansion's world and enhance the immersion.

  "title":"The theming in the Haunted Mansion queue leaves something to be desired.",
  "text":"The Mansion, on the inside, is one of the best themed attractions in Disneyland. The detail in the Hall of Paintings and in the ride itself is impeccable, especially given its age and time of construction. However, even though the immaculately manicured lawn and punny graves that were placed in the queue are well made and give a sense of the \"goofy but scary\" atmosphere the HM aims for, its simply too simplistic, especially given the amount of time one spends in the queue.\n\n\nThe Florida Haunted Mansion has interactive elements in the queue to keep guests entertained and to further enhance the theming, pulling us out of the real world and into the Mansion's. I know Florida's HM was made much later and with much more space and resources than the DLR's, but I do think there is room for improvement. Here are some ideas I've come up with to make the theming in the HM queue more effective, borrowing ideas from other rides and attractions that have well-done queue theming.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMaybe play some creepy music throughout the queue, or at least have the Mansion emit some screams and creaks now and again, to display the \"Haunted\" part of the Haunted Mansion. As of now, the Mansion feels like it just sits there, with not a hint of the spooky spectres and grinning ghosts it hosts. Heck, even the Fastpass statue garden has unsettling music box-esque backing music and interesting statues.\n\n\n\n\nMaybe isolate the guests in the queue from the street outside, to better place guests in the Mansion's world and enhance the immersion. Our ToT had this issue as well, where it was a bit difficult to feel creeped out and unsettled when guests walking by and the sounds from Bug's Land were easily seen and heard.

With that said, we CANNOT miss Haunted Mansion. I heard they close this in Jan to remove the holiday overlay. What's the likelihood that this ride will be closed or, when might it be back in operation?\n\n\nAlso, absolutely do not want to miss Paint The Night, Fantasmic, and possibly World of Color. I had a bad experience in the aughts with WDW. Seems that Fantasmic wasn't every day back then. In fact, it was like once a week. With it being the off season, would Disney not have these shows\/parades during the weekday off peak?\n\n\nHow much will Paradise Pier be closed\/finished by then?\n\n\nAnything else scheduled for closure? With both HM and Jungle Cruise being closed, with Small World and Splash Mountain, I can't imagine them closing more, but we definitely CANNOT MISS Indiana Jones or Roger Rabbit either. I've waited decades for these rides to get to MGM, even rode Temple of Peril believing that was it (can't stand roller coasters). We cannot miss these.\n\n\nEDIT - plans are now the following week (22nd-24th)",

Would it be best to pick the first FP based by park or best available? After obtaining the first pass, would it be better to again base it of park or best available? I imagine earlier in the day, it would be best to go by best available, and once things back up \/ get busier, based by park. \n\n\nI imagine there will be times, where it won\u2019t be possible to go back to back on fast passes (especially saturday on a summer day). But, What have people done to optimize their time \/ less walking back and forth? \n\n\nWe used to walk between parks before MaxPass existed, and it worked out well, and used rides that didn\u2019t have FP to kill time, but now that we have this luxury. curious to see what people do now. \n\n\nPriorities in this order: GotG, Radiator Springs, Indy, Space Mt, Matterhorn, Splash Mt\nAnd the Other FPs (Toy Story Mania, Buzz, Screaming, Grizzly, Haunted Mansion, Big thunder), we used to use a buffers to pass time in-between fast passes. \n\n\nAdditional Question: After redeeming one FP, I noticed one can obtain a FP immediately after.

  "text":"Wow this actually ended up being longer than I expected it to be and ended up being a summary of the history of DCA.\n\n\nDCA has changed A LOT over the past 16 and a half years of operation. If you've probably gone every five years since the 2001, you'd notice that the park was drastically different every time.\n\n\nDCA 1.0(2001-2007) - The park when it first opened to lower than expected attendance and not short of any criticism whatsoever. Large amount of attractions were deemed the \"off the shelf type\", such as Maliboomer or Muholland Madness. There was also a lack of rides for children, or actually a lack of rides in general. There was also no nighttime entertainment.  In response to this a bug's land opened in 2002, and the Main Street electrical parade was brought over to DCA within 6 months of opening. DCA received their own Twilight Zone Tower of Terror in 2004. Despite all these changes. DCA still wasn't much of a different park, and attendance was was still fairly low.\n\n\nDCA 2.0(2008-2015) - With attendance declining in 2007, Disney realized the park was still mediocre and announced a major expansion. First on the list... Paradise Pier. Mickey's head on Screamin' and The Sun on the sun wheel were switched, and designs were less contemporary. Rides around paradise pier were rethemed with a focus on Disney characters. Midway Mania came in 2008. The Paradise Pier renovation ended with a the arrival of World of Color  in 2010 and Ariel's Undersea Adventure in 2011.  The entire main entrance plaza was redone as Sunshine Plaza was replaced with Buena Vista Street and Cars Land opening in 2012.  The park was left relatively untouched for the most part after 2012. Probably mostly because the 60th Anniversary was being planned. In early 2015, Condor Flats was rethemed as Grizzly Peak airfield and Luigi's Flying Tires was closed.\n\n\nDCA3.0 (2016-present)  - Many drastic changes (some controversial) have come to the park since early 2016. First was the changing of the popular \"Aladdin - A Musical Spectacular\" into \"Frozen - Live at the Hyperion\". The show, however proved to be quite successful, but has also seen many changes throughout its first year, such as completely cutting \"Frozen Heart\" from the show, but many are also improvements. Soarin' Over California became Soarin' Over the World in June 2016. The most controversial change so far has been converting Tower of Terror into Guardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout. Despite all of the negativity towards it in the beginning(petitions and such), the ride has proven to be massively popular and pretty well liked( I'm probably thankful as it has also brought down the average wait time of Radiator Springs Racers from around 120-135 to around 60-75). Coming in the future is another probably controversial change, Pixar Pier, which a lot of people so far think is unnecessary. But time will tell how people will initially react to it when it first opens just as we had seen with Guardians and Frozen Live. Just as they capped of DCA 2.0 with a major Cars Land Expansion. DCA 3.0 will be capped off with the major Marvel Expansion.\n\n\nWith a bunch of these unexpected changes, who knows what DCA will look like on its 50th Anniversary?",

Of course I'm sure they wouldn't want people doing this anywhere it would block traffic, but I'm thinking of little out of the way corners. For example the one of the future corridors to Star Wars Land, which is essentially a wall, or the the little corner linked below at the edge of Pooh's ride. Little out of the way corners like that.\n\n\nI'm not talking about bringing food from outside the park, I mean eating the food I buy inside the park on the floor. It's way more comfortable for me to sit my kids on a blanket in the corner for lunch than struggle to keep them sitting quietly at a cramped table surrounded by other people.\n\n\nPeople sit on picnic blankets as they camp out for the parades, so to some extent they allow people to camp out on the floor.  For some reason though I get the feeling if I tried to pull this off a cast member would ask me to sit in a designated seating area in chairs...\n\n\nA quiet corner for picnicking?\n\nhttps:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/@33.8119527,-117.9232221,3a,75y,215.03h,76.85t\/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipOIQswrQLc6tArO8hfclfZksvkBwnnGO27_bK9d!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipOIQswrQLc6tArO8hfclfZksvkBwnnGO27_bK9d%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi0-ya74.58993-ro-0-fo100!7i4000!8i2000",

If I book a trip to go next week, the same room is $429 a night. There is a summer deal right now where if you book from July 18 through September 28, 2017 and travel by September 29, 2017 you get this great pricing.\n\n\nMy question is, do they do this \"every\" year?

For the past two years we've celebrated our birthdays in the parks at the end of September, but this year we are starting a family and the extensive travel (we're from Canada) just isn't realistic, as much as we'd both love to.\n\n\nStill, she's a little bummed that we won't be getting to the parks this year, and I'd like to do something for her birthday that makes her feel like I've brought a little WDW to life at home.\n\n\nNow, the largest problem is that I'm not a terribly creative person. I recently discovered soundsofdisneyland.com and plan to use that to set the mood for her for when she gets home from work that day, but outside of that, I'm struggling.\n\n\nSo, \/r\/Disneyland, are there any ways that you keep the Disney spirit alive at home when you're not at the parks? What kinds of things would you personally enjoy in a Disney themed birthday? Any help is much appreciated.",

However, they just show up as guests and I can't figure out how to tie them to a specific person on my account (if I even can). If I log into the Disneyland website itself on my computer, it doesn't show any linked tickets at all (do they only show up on the app? That seems odd). \n\n\nIs it going to be an issue that both tickets are linked on my account and showing up as guests rather than under my name and her name, if I want to purchase and use MaxPass when we get there? For that matter, will we have issues getting into the park if they're both linked on my account? I'm a longtime veteran of WDW and this is my first time at DL, so I'm used to the Fastpass+ system and WDW's online stuff, where I tie each \"ticket\" to a specific person on my account and book FPs that way, but I can't for the life of me figure out any way to tie each ticket to a specific person here. I know I can't get or use MaxPass until I'm actually at the park, I just want to make sure before I get there that it's going to actually work.",

I'm super excited and have read dozens of Disney travel sites, books, and Reddit threads, but I have a few unanswered \"stupid\" questions I want to clarify before I land at LAX.\n\n\n\n\nFastPasses are paper, right? Then what's the deal with \"MaxPass?\"\n\nWhen I was buying my DL tickets, I was offered \"MaxPass\" for about $100 more per ticket. Is MaxPass beta testing for a new electronic FP system at DL - similar to the WDW FP system? I didn't purchase it and assumed the paper FP system would still be in place. Did I make the right decision or do I need to purchase MaxPass?\n\n\n\n\nAny chance that a few Halloween decorations will go up early?\n\nHalloween officially begins at DL on Sept. 15, but since we'll only be there Sept. 13-14 (this was intentional - we wanted to avoid crowds), is there any chance that a few Halloween decorations will be up while we're there? Or do they literally do it all overnight? A few different Reddit threads on this topic contradict each other, so I wasn't sure.\n\n\n\n\nFantasmic, Fireworks, and Paint the Night won't be running on my dates, right?\n\nAccording to the official Disneyland daily show schedule\/event calendar, Fantasmic, Paint the Night, and the Fireworks won't run at all during my two-day trip (Sept. 13-14).

I guess I'm used to WDW where there are shows every night!\n\n\n\n\nIs there anything else I should know as a WDW Veteran\/DL Newbie before entering the parks?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!",

Hiding behind things and people) he made her laugh and found a way to engage her in a way none of the others were able too (nor is it their job too). I snapped a quick photo of him (she likes to look at the photos after her freak out and talk about swing them). Some how it's an amazing photo one I think he \/ or she would be SUPER proud of.   Embodies both their dedication to their job and the Character himself. \n\n\nIf you can contact that spidey please let me know and I'll send you the photo to send along   Thank you again Spider-Man. \n\n\nImage. \n\n\nhttps:\/\/m.imgur.com\/a\/d01rx",

Here's what we're watching tonight\" intro for them.\n\n\nI'll be hitting Disneyland here in a month and a half - and I thought it would be cool to shoot one, something like \"Welcome to my show, I'm here with my good friend Snow White [or whomever].

We are going to Disneyland next week for our daughters birthday and we are obviously very excited.\n\n\nRelatively recently I was grabbed from a parking lot and gang raped. I have been diagnosed with complex PTSD because of this and I experienced a lot of abuse growing up homeless.\nSo I don't do well in crowds or standing in a line where I can't make a quick exit.\nI also don't feel safe in public spaces alone.\nI'm aware of the DAS and that I am not allowed to provide any documentation of this. \nWhen we went last year I had a broken foot and was in a wheelchair. Using the DAS alleviated so many of my concerns. Now that I am not in a wheelchair and have an \"invisible disability\" I don't know how to share the most personal thing in my life to a stranger in front of a line of people at Main Street to admit what happened to me and how it affects my day to day life. \nI don't want to have to say all this in front of my daughter either.\n\n\nAny advice? I've seen redditors and cast members in this sub say \"I don't understand why people who don't do well in crowds bother coming to Disneyland and expect to be accommodated.\"\nMy assault took so much away from me. Disneyland is magic and I don't want to take away the experience for my family and especially our daughter.\n\n\nMy husband and I have been brainstorming on what we can do to accommodate me. We don't want to split up as I mentioned I don't do well alone in public places, so him and our daughter waiting in line alone isn't an option as well as if we did split up I don't get good cell service in the parks so I wouldn't be able to communicate with him if I need to.\nI called and there is no way to inform the parks in advance of this.\nI just don't want to be shamed or revictimized when I go to tell a cast member what happened and my limitations.\nAny advice on what to do or how to word this would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you so much!",

  "text":"First time visiting Disneyland this week and overall having a great time, however I'm disappointed with operations. Each day the attractions are either running at 1\/2 or 1\/4 capacity, attractions are constantly breaking down, evacuating, etc. It has happened to me on nearly every ride, and many rides each day. This is in addition to the E ticket rides that are already closed for refurb. There was a day in Disneyland where Space, Mansion, Pirates, Peter Pan, Indiana Jones, Splash, and a couple other rides were all reporting as closed in the app. \n\n\nOn one particularly unlucky stretch, Indiana Jones was closed during my fastpass window and Pirates was temporarily closed (for like half the day), so I went to Fantasyland and got in line for Storybook Canal, and then after 20 minutes Casey Jr. stopped and had to be fully evacuated, so we waited with no idea of how long it would be, but there was no easy way to exit the queue since it was so tightly packed, so we ended up waiting an hour for that. Then we went to Alice and waited 30 minutes for the ride to break down and get fully evacuated again, so we waited for operations to resume and then after 3 cars were loaded the ride broke down again and everyone was required to leave the queue. Then I went to Small World and got on that quickly, but during the ride it came to a complete stop and I waited for 30 minutes in the same spot before the boats started moving at a snail's pace again.\n\n\nRight now I'm standing in line for TSM and it just broke down again with no estimate on when it will be back. They have also been running at half capacity on soarin, Star Tours and other attractions, despite fairly solid crowds. \n\n\nSurely this is just a string of really bad luck we're having and not typical for operations here? I know this is considered the slow season but it seems a bit ridiculous.\n\n\nUPDATE\n....annnnnd I just got evacuated and walked off of Big Thunder at midnight. That's the end of my trip, lol.",

Maybe by walking?\n\n\nAny other must-knows? I'm going to browse through this subreddit for sure but wanted to ask! Thanks all :)",

  "text":"Was in line for Indy today and a guest was yelling at a cast member. Apparently he was in line earlier in the day when the ride broke down and he now wanted to skip straight to the front. A cast member was explaining that the furthest he could skip to was the video room because \"by law\" all guests must watch the safety video.\nI don't know if it's completely true or just some fluff they give to guests, but if it is true I wonder why only certain rides require it? Matterhorn and thunder don't have videos like that. Maybe they have audio recordings with safety instructions? \nJust found it interesting. \nFelt sorry for the cast member. The guy was seriously pissed off and yelling at him.",

On our most recent trip just a couple weeks ago we even visited the DVC presentation and we're very intrigued by the prospect. We were already planning a big trip to WDW for the 50th in 2021 and can purchase the DVC up front with the money we've saved. With the DVC we would be able to visit Disneyland even more plus a few weekend getaways here and there. And we would have the ability to go to WDW and DL. \n\n\nAre there any Oregon residents that have\/had annual passes?\n\n\nAny DVC members experience doing something like this?\n\n\nAm I crazy?",

I'm going December 7, 8, 9th and the website says the 8th is a \"It's Packed\" and the 9th is a \"Forget About It\" day. I went December 9, 10, 11 in 2014 and it was fine, so is the 7-9 this year really gonna be all that different? Saturdays I guess are expected to be.\n\n\nI don't know what I'm looking for here.

  "title":"APs a double edged sword?",
  "text":"Since getting Annual Passports for my daughter and myself last January we have logged 38 park visit which has given me a opportunity to see the park on different days and in different seasons.\n\n\nAnyone who has been to the park knows that one of the biggest annoyances is the large crowds and long lines. Recently even with the price hike for the Annual Passports it seems to me that more and more locals are not only buying and using APs but they are shelling out the around $1000 for the signature and signature plus passes with free parking and no blackout unlimited entry. Good for the company but maybe not so much for the average park guest. This last Saturday Sept. 22nd I took my daughter to Disneyland and I have never waited so long just to get into the park and when we did I literally could not move on Main Street for 10 Mins until I finally had to fight my way through. I noticed that for every ticket guest there was at least one AP holder and this was on a black out day to all but Signature holders.\n\n\nMy point being... Do you think Disney should offer unlimited no blackout entry options. Do you think it contributes to overcrowding in the park and would it be better if they only offered limited entry (say one weekend a month and all weekdays) as an alternative? Obviously the more the better for the company as that is revenue for them so I ask as a park guest.\n\n\nDisclaimer: I myself am a signature AP holder and use it frequently so I am no judging or blaming any specific group for park overcrowding. This is not meet to be a rant just a curious question",

However, when you go to book on their website, they make it clear that you must pay in full one month prior, which simply isn't possible this time, and our schedule after that week is not malleable.\n\n\nMy question is, does anyone have any experience reserving a disney hotel and not paying until several days before you go?
