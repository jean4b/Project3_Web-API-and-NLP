  "text":"I'm an annual pass-holder, and I own an interactive wand. The experience is great, but one thing that really bothers me is when I see a child wandering up to a spell point and wanting to try it out, but not being able to. For whatever reason, not every parent can afford an additional $50 for a wand. I understand, when I was a kid there was no way my parents would pay for something that extravagant that would only work in the park. \n\n\nThis is a situation where everyone loses. The child can't enjoy this experience, the parent is guilty of not being able to give this child this experience, and on-lookers that have empathy will feel for this family. While I was there every time I ran into a kid that wanted to try but can't, I'd lend them my wand. Heck, if I could afford it I'd give them all wands. \n\n\nI understand why Universal has the policy in place where staff members can't let kids use their wand. They want to turn a profit. I just think that for kids under the age of 16 or so, all tickets should come with a cheap, chopstick-quality wand with the simple reflective lens on the end. Doesn't work as well, doesn't look as nice, but can still be used to give the kids an experience at magic.\n\n\nWhat do you guys\/gals think? Is this feesible? Production cost would be low, it might cut into some of the profit, but I think it's be worth it to make for a better atmosphere at the park.",

Mythos is good, but big and expensive.  So, our goto this time has been Breadbox.  Its in Citywalk, across from Panda Express, Burger King, and Moe's.  Here's why we liked it:\n*The food was GOOD.  Its hot and cold sandwiches served with fries.  Could get it as healthy as you wanted but everything we had was great - Tomato and Mozzarella sandwich, pastrami, turkey, BLTA(avocado), and grill cheese (the kids one - it was awesome).  High quality great tasting.  Fries are awesome.  Nice change from the normal Universal restaurants.\n\n\n*Staff - they were all awesome.  We were there multiple times and across the board friendly, helpful, and attentive.\n\n\n*Never crowded.  We were there at noon two days in a row, Saturday and Sunday.

We met twice in the first half of June, 2015 in the Hogsmeade section of WWoHP. The first time we met was at The Three Broomsticks on June 5th, I think, and he was running the register around 10:30-11am at the start of lunch. The second time we met was on June 15th around 8-8:30pm at the Butterbeer cart that he was working right outside of The Three Broomsticks. I had told him that he reminded me of Peter Pan so we joked about how he secretly was Peter Pan. The second time we ran into each other he called us a \"power couple\" since we were both awesome enough to remember each other from the last time we'd met. We also joked about some Harry Potter stuff, like how I had an Invisibility Cloak. There was more to the convo but anyway, I really enjoyed our conversation and his wit\/sense of humor. I would enjoy talking with him again, so if there's anyone who's reading this that might have a clue on how to do that, that would be really cool. Thanks in advance to anyone who tries to help, I appreciate it. :)\n\n\nMy name is Katie, but I'll sign this as \"Wendy\" since Will is secretly Peter Pan, hahaha xP",

  "title":"Personal concern about Forbidden Journey (would like input from IOA team members, if possible)",
  "text":"So, the last time I went to IOA (not too long ago; I'm a passholder, after all), I decided to hop on Forbidden Journey, mainly because I hadn't been on it in a while. Now, before we go on, I need to talk about myself: when last measured, I stood at about 5'6.5\" (5 ft., 6.5 inches), and I can say that the majority of that is in my legs, which, as those who have ridden FJ know, are dangling throughout the whole thing. I didn't think that would necessarily be a problem until I got on, when I discovered it wasn't too much of a stretch for me to move my legs too much and end up touching some of the scenery (I didn't, BTW), particularly in the observatory and Forbidden Forest scenes.\n\n\nNow, I love this ride very much, and I don't want to have to stop riding it because of my increasing height. Should I be concerned in the first place? Or should I just keep my legs close to the bench at all times?",

I hadn't been since the opening of Hogsmeade, so there were a lot of new things to be experienced.\n\n\nAnyway, I was curious on whether anyone had any insight as to the Transformers ride story. In the queue Optimus suggests that sending humans in Evac is crucial to the mission, but all it really seems to do is hold Evac back by keeping him from transforming fully, and force the other Autobots to save him constantly. It's a great ride and I enjoyed it immensely. I was just surprised that the story pretext was so flimsy after coming from Spider-Man, which (cleverly, I thought) subverts the 'something goes wrong' trope by having JJJ acknowledge that he's sending you into senseless danger explicitly for his own gain.

  "text":"If you are bigger, you should research which rides you can fit.  At the front of each ride line where this is an issue there is typically a demonstration seat that you can try.  The worst ride for this is the Hogwarts castle ride.  It's the smallest seat in the park, excluding kids only rides of course.\n\n\nThe other issue is that if you don't fit in a normal seat, but the ride has \"modified\" seating you should be aware of what this means and the limitations it will put on you and\/or your group.  Modified seating is typically a special seat that can accommodate bigger people.  On the \"Rockin Rollercoaster\", or whatever it's called, this means that there are 2 seats on each train car that you'll fit in.  They're both in the middle of 4 seats.  This means that if you ride by yourself you'll have to sit in the middle of another group.  This is awkward to say the least.  It will also means that your group will have to ride with you and won't be able to ride in the front row and may have to wait in line longer. \n\n\nLastly, the ride staff are typically helpful about this but it can be very embarrassing if they're not.  \n\n\nFood for thought.",

  "text":"Hey, all! I've hatched a plan to surprise my wife with a trip to Universal Orlando in September. I'll fill you in on that part and then ask a few questions I have.\n\n\nMy best friend is getting married in upstate New York on Sept. 10 and I've got my wife convinced we'll be spending the week prior to the wedding day traveling around NYC, which she's not too thrilled about (big cities aren't her thing).\n\n\nI also have her convinced that it's cheaper for us to fly from OKC to Syracuse, NY, by way of an extended Orlando layover. She thinks we'll be spending the night at a hotel near Orlando International when, really, we'll be staying five nights on-site at Universal with four-day park-to-park tickets.\n\n\nShe's always wanted to go, loves Harry Potter and will be absolutely thrilled (and shocked that I planned this all out 200 days beforehand). I grew up in Southern California so Universal Studios Hollywood was a normal thing for me. That said, I haven't been since 1999.\n\n\nHere are some questions I have, if ya'll don't mind imparting some knowledge and wisdom:\n\n\n\n\nWe will most likely use Universal's shuttle service to and from the airport. Is this shuttle clearly a Universal shuttle, with artwork all over the vehicle? I'm basically wanting to know so I can figure out when she'd realize what we're doing.\n\n\n\n\nOur first park day will be Labor Day. I've read mixed reviews on how busy Universal gets on this day. How busy have you seen it on Labor Day?\n\n\n\n\nWhere are some of the best places to eat in both parks and CityWalk? Doesn't matter if it's counter or full service.\n\n\n\n\nMy wife has a gluten allergy. Is Universal good about accommodating people with gluten allergies?\n\n\n\n\nI'm waiting to see what people think of Sapphire Falls before I decide on a hotel. My wife likes the themeing of Cabana Bay, based on videos we've watched from DIS Unplugged and TheTimTracker, so we might stay there. Which hotel do you recommend and why?\n\n\n\n\nAnything else I should know?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks, everyone!",

  "title":"Making your own Interactive Wand",
  "text":"I've got some ideas on how to make a home-brew version of the interactive wands' tip, but I'm nowhere near Orlando, so I need park-goers to help me test these ideas out! \n\n\nHere is what we know about how the interactive wands. The wands themselves contain no electronic parts, but the tip is a black glass bead with a silvery coating underneath. The interactive windows themselves have an infrared light emitter, which is reflected by the wand tip and read by a sensor. So it should be possible to construct a home-brew interactive wand tip. Here are a few ways I think it could work: \n\n\nFor methods 1 and 2, start with a \"wand\" that has a round tip. This can be a chopstick, a pen, or whatever. This is important because you want the sensor to pick up the reflected light even if your \"wand\" isn't pointing straight at it.\n\n\n\n\nCover the tip of the \"wand\" with \nretro-reflective tape.\n Retro-reflective surfaces (as opposed to just reflective surfaces) reflect light in the same direction as the source. \n\n\n\n\nCover the tip of the \"wand\" with tiny \nretro-reflective microbeads.\n First, apply some glue to the tip, then dip it in the beads.\n\n\n\n\nFor this method, start with a \"wand\" that has a flat end (like a dowel). Glue some retro-reflective tape to a flat side of a \n4mm glass dome\n so that the reflective part is \nfacing\n the glass. Then attach the bead, tape-side first, to the tip of the dowel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you try any of these methods, let me know if they work!",

  "text":"Good Morning, afternoon, or evening depending on the time that your reading this. Biohazard: The Escape 2. Located all the way in Osaka, Japan inside of Universal Studios Japan, Biohazard: the Escape 2 is I assume the sequel to the first escape room where you have one hour to escape. It takes place in what looks like a four story rethemed office building splashed with blood with various rooms from research labs to medical rooms, it's a highly themed escape the room experience. When you enter the attraction, you are put in a small group and they are your family for the next two hours. They give you an smart phone and tablet the has English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and a couple other languages that I didn't have time to notice. So it's very accessible if you live in Asia or if you speak\/read English, so stay in school kids. They also give you a map that explains the layout of the experience. And I can honestly say it is huge, many different rooms on the four levels and some you need special access to get into. \n\n\nYou are introduced to the story with a quick \"presentation on the umbrella company\" until something goes wrong. One of the hosts who is wearing all white gets shot I think they use a squib and its pretty shocking\/surpising because it comes out of nowhere. A group of counter umbrella corp. takes over the presentation proclaiming that they've taken the T-virus the guy who has the T-virus leaves the room and mysteriously dies. I hate it when that happens and in true resident evil style his death accidently releases the virus through out the building. At this moment the U.B.C.S. shows up and points shotguns and guns at the counter group. But zombies appear in the room that you are in and they focus their attention of the problem of the many zombies. Pushing them back through the doors and shutting the automatic doors. Then from the other side a Tyrant comes through the door and starts beating the crap out of everyone. They shot it infront of an electrical box and open the automatic doors and push him out with the zombies with shotgun blasts as force. We are told the automatic security system is active and will blow up the building in one hour, hey how lucky that's the average time of an escape the room, your only hope is to find the various antidotes to the virus and escape. And with that you are pushed inside of the building. \n\n\nYou can start on any floor you like, but at the beginning only the third and first floor are accessible. And the puzzles are extremely challenging, if you know your resident evil lore some of the puzzles might be easier to solve at the beginning. But, the massive difficultly curve really hits after you figure out your first five puzzles. I forgot to mention that all this time there are zombies jumping out at you, or blended into rooms. So you might be looking for something and distracted you leads to a very surprised you, when a zombie appears out of nowhere. Which does add to the experience. \n\n\nMy group and myself honestly didn't get that far into the puzzles before it was time for the \"end game\". It was really really difficult. At the end of the show they show you in Japanese, what all the solutions were. And man they were ridiculously complex. It takes about twenty minutes to explain it all. You might have to have a B.A. in puzzle solving just to make it through this. But, somehow there was one winner who was allowed to escape through the exit of the attraction. The rest of us dolts were treated to an ending show were Nemesis, the tyrant, and the bad guy from resident evil two come out and wreck havoc between the U.B.C.S. and the counter umbrella group. Which by the way, their costumes looked ten times better then the haunted house at Halloween Horror Nights 23. It was a little cheesy but at the end we all died. And the words appeared, \"You are dead.\" It was a kookie experience, I have no idea how you would be able to solve all these problems on your first time through but hey thats life I suppose. It's worth a look, if you are in Japan and really want to do this is worth the trip but I would save your time for the Biohazard: the real attraction which is much better.\n\n\nBut if this wet your appetite for more Universal Studios Japan check out this video I just shot featuring the early morning rope drop and the new rollercoaster the flying dinosaur.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eKa_Fdp9qU4",

I have been to islands of adventure approximately 6 years ago and was able to experience almost all of it because of there hardly being any lines that day. Main reason i would want to do both parks is to experience the hogwarts express and visit hogsmeade again and maybe a few of the harry potter rides in Islands, but if this will ruin Universal for me then i rather just stick to universal studios.

  "text":"I just got back from HHN and I thought it'd be nice to make a list for first-time goers... so here it is: (feel free to add) \n\n\nDisclaimer: This is my first year attending HHN so perhaps some or a lot of the items on this list are known. Sorry if that is the case!\n\n\n\n\nTry to arrive at the park early - like even more than an hour early - unless you don't mind waiting in a line to park. If you come right around the time that the day park closes then you may run into more traffic. \n\n\nDon't try to bring food or drinks into the park because you will be asked to throw them out. You can have empty bottles that you can re-fill with water inside the park. NO CHAINS - not even wallets with accessory chains. Park security check is pretty thorough with attendants checking bags and you will be asked to walk through a metal detector. \n\n\nTry to eat a meal beforehand at CityWalk to minimize eating downtime in the park. Perhaps you could use the extra time you have if you came earlier to grab some food by the food court or wherever. \n\n\nDon't bring face masks or make-up (I'm guessing they mean like monster make-up). \n\n\nOnly some attractions aside from the mazes are open. Harry Potter World is NOT open. \n\n\nTry to be inside the park at the opening of HHN so that you can go through at least one maze with a relatively short wait time. \n\n\nDo NOT start with the terror tram. There is only two very short walk-throughs (one nearby the Bates motel and one behind the War of the Worlds wreckage) associated with it in the backlot and there isn't much else other than a photo-op at the Psycho house. Neither walk-throughs are that special (they are not based on any films\/TV shows). The queue for the tram was pretty much a no-wait throughout the night. \n\n\nAlso, do not start with the Jabbawockee show. Although the house was mostly full, it wasn't all too popular in terms of waiting in line. The show itself was good (kinda cheesy IMO) and I would recommend it as a way to take a break and sit down. It's really cold in there though in the Special Effects Stage. \n\n\nDo start with one of the features (4 mazes) in the lower lot where Jurassic Park is. Some of them today had wait times up to 2 hours+ at even just 30 minutes after HHN opened. \n\n\nApparently there was early entry today an hour before HHN was supposed to open? The terror tram and some mazes were open (maybe why some wait times were really long from the very beginning?). Perhaps you can keep up with HHN Facebook page to see if that's relevant for the day that you're going.\n\n\n\n\nExtra-tip: Try to purchase your tickets in advance and online for discounts. If this is going to be your first and perhaps last time attending HHN then I would recommend a front-of-the-line pass, which is available while supplies last. \n\n\nALSO: Please be courteous and try not smoke during the line. Don't be an ass by line hopping. Lastly, don't be that obnoxious person who thinks it's cool to scare the scarers because you \"can't be scared.\"\n\n\nOff-topic \/ Highlight of today: I got to see Evan Peters, who stars in American Horror Story, just before he entered the AHS maze. No chance of interaction though. I think there were some other people there but I didn't catch any other sightings. \n\n\nI hope you have fun with your experience!",

  "title":"Universal Studios Orlando Park-to-Park Ticket Price Question",
  "text":"Hello! Aussie traveller here. I'll be visiting Orlando in December of this year (the week before Christmas) as part of a bigger USA trip. My girlfriend is mad for Harry Potter. We've already booked our accommodation at Cabana Bay (four nights) and I'm currently looking into ticket prices for three full days. I know we'll be visiting in a peak period, but before I buy tickets I just thought I'd ask; what's the lowest price a 3-day park-to-park ticket will sell for before the end of December? At the moment, Undercover Tourist has a promo for a 2-day park-to-park with an extra 2 days free, totalling 4 days which makes this promo pass ($226.88) cheaper than the 3-day ($237.16); but as we'll only have the 3 days for Universal, I thought I'd check with ya'll to see if there was any history of 3-day passes dropping in price, or if you knew of anywhere else reputable to get cheaper park tickets from. Apologies if this is common knowledge or a frustrating question; we're trying to stick to a relatively tight budget, and every dollar counts!",

Right now, our flight lands at 1:30 on a day the park closes at 6 PM, so we'd only get a couple hours that day, and one full day after that.\n\n\nWe're mostly interested in the Harry Potter sections of the parks, so that's the main motivation for the trip.  I wouldn't mind seeing what all else it has to offer, though, so I'm wondering if I should fly out one day sooner so I can have two full days there.\n\n\nTo be honest, extreme thrill rides aren't really my thing.  I'm OK with motion simulators, but anything terrifying and 'real', I'd probably just skip.  I'm not sure how much that would rule out for me, but it would free up time for other sightseeing while I'm there.\n\n\nSo with those factors, is one day plus change enough to see all the Harry Potter stuff?  We've got park hoppers, so we'll be able to hit both sections in one day.  Or would you recommend we take two full days to check out the entirety of the parks?\n\n\nThanks!",

  "title":"our trip with young child",
  "text":"Need a bit of advice. We are planning a trip to Orlando in June. Our ultimate goal being to go to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. So it's like $165\/person to get into both parks which is fine, but that's kind of a lot when considering we will have Our 18 month old with us and that's like an all day thing which is a bit much for a 1 year old. Especially since she probably won't have much of a nap that day. And I'm sure it will be hella hot. So I'm wondering if it would be better to just do half and which half should we choose or should we just spring for the whole thing and hope for the best? Is it even worth it to only do half? We are hitching a ride with husbands mom who is going there anyway for a convention. She will also be paying for our hotel. If not for these things we wouldn't be going with a child so young. But it's kind of a rare opportunity and I've been sooo wanting to go to the wizarding world of hp. Thanks a bunch!!!",

  "title":"Some stories of mine from working at Islands of Adventure.",
  "text":"So I worked at IOA for a few months, I would have loved to have continued working there if not for the fact that I was moving out of state. I was hired to work in attractions and given a choice between a few options, I opted for 'Jurassic Park: River adventure' which was my overall first choice. Something about the mix of animatronics, the smell of the chlorinated water, the theme music, and the nature ambience they play makes it a ride that I've always loved. It was pretty cool getting to see the ins and outs of the ride. Fun fact: right at the top before you drop there is a person sitting in a box to the right making sure no one is taking out a phone or selfie stick.\n\n\nI had a few really great experiences with guests. I was working in front of the ride and an Irish family came up and asked how scary the ride was. The family had a mother, father, young daughter (13 I'd guess) and a young boy (8 I'd guess). The boy was a little nervous. I tried my best to convince him he'd be safe to no avail (I said \"You look pretty tough, I think you can keep your family safe from the dinosaurs.\") I asked them if they were Conor McGregor fans (The Irish MMA champion). They said very emphatically yes, especially the boy. I am a huge fan of McGregor, so I started talking to them about him. The boy lit up talking about the fights he'd seen live, which I'd also seen live as well. I joked that if on the ride the dinosaurs came for them he could just KO them with a straight left like McGregor. I told them that if they came back and he had changed his mind about getting on the ride I'd bring them to the front of the line (it was Christmas day and unbelievably busy, I'm talking oceans of people haha.) They came back in a bit and said I'd convinced him talking about McGregor. All the way up to the front ( I brought them through the back so other guests would not see) the kid kept talking to me about Conor. When they were about to get on the mother shook my hand, I felt a dollar bill inside, I assumed it was a 1 or a 5. I told them they were absolute legends and waved them goodbye. I went to the break room to take a quick look at the bill, and it was a 100. I'm a pretty broke college student who was not even getting holiday pay for working Christmas, I was really over whelmed with positive emotions. I saw them outside later in the day and they thanked me for convincing him and I thanked them for making my day. I told the kid:\"Anything for a fellow McGregor fan.\"\n\n\nOn my last day of work I was there really early. It was basically empty. A large French Canadian family came to the front and was getting on when a young girl (I'd guess 12) very nervously got off, started crying, and ran away from the ride. Her family (I assume) said a few joking things to her. I felt pretty bad. I guided her to a waiting area and tried to say something to her but I realized she spoke no english. When I was first hired they told us we could get gifts for guests in certain circumstances. I felt so bad for this girl. When I was young I was such a little wimp too and my family busted my chops all the same. I asked my manager if it was Ok for me to give them a gift for free and she said 'No problem'. When they got off I stopped them and told one of the English speaking parents that the young girl could pick out anything under $30 from the gift store totally for free. They told the girl and she seemed so much happier. She hugged me, which I was not expecting, but was really cute and heart warming. I talked to her family and she looked around the store for something. She found a sweat shirt she liked (which was actually $37 but I asked my manager and again she said it was fine). I told her (through a translating parent) that when I was a kid I was really scared of the Jaws ride so I understand. She hugged me again, and they left.\n\n\nAnyway, I hope some of you get a kick out of these stories. I've got a lot more if you like, or if you have any questions about what it was like working there just let me know. It was seriously one of the most fun things I've ever got to do.",

  "text":"As the title says, I am contemplating taking three trips to Orlando next year with the wife and two kids to go to Universal. We went once, two years ago and fell in love. Now I am thinking about going for mardi gras (February), my daughters birthday (June), and for Thanksgiving\/Christmas (November or December).\nThe season passes are pretty cheap. Only 200-300 more total for all four of us versus a 4-day star.\nThe tricky part comes with the hotel\/food\/transportation arrangements.\nTransportation: We live in Louisiana, so the drive is not bad. However, my kids have never flown and I have a ton of miles banked, so we will likely fly once or twice and drive the other time. The times that we fly will be tricky. Ideally, I would like to find a good deal on a hotel, which has a shuttle service to and from Orland. Through Universal Partner Hotel Vacation Packages, I was able to find 11 hotels that offer park shuttles. COCO KEY HOTEL AND WATER RESORT - ORLANDO looks like a lot of fun if we made the trip in June and the rates are reasonable. Same with The Point Orlando Resort. There is always uber\/lyft as well. Any recommendations here would be great!\nSleeping: This one is a little tough. I did find a campground pretty close that has cabins. I think this would be a blast for us as a family. An airBnB another time would also be a good option. Something that would allow us to have room instead of a single hotel room. Also, a full kitchen for breakfast and supper would cut down on the cost as well. I have not had much luck finding an affordable, but not trashy, hotel as well. Something not to far if there is no shuttle service would be nice.\nFood: Should I meal pass or not? Does seem really worth it. $84 per day will get you 1 quick service meal, 1 drink, and 1 snack. We'll eat at the hotel for breakfast and dinner.\nAppreciate everybody's thoughts. Would love to make it a year to remember!",

  "title":"Top 5 Wishlist for Universal Orlando",
  "text":"Whats your top 5? We already know Nintendo is coming so I wouldn't include that, but it can be what attractions you want, restaurants, hope for the new parks, etc! Heres mine! \n\n\n\n\nHow To Train Your Dragon Ride Thats in Dubai:\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FQgaf5Sigo4\n\nI mean, it looks amazing and perfect for this IP. I really hope this somehow makes its way into the new park. I understand getting the rights to the specific ride is near impossible but I mean, this looks amazing and groundbreaking. And its DreamWorks best IP imo. \n\n\n\n\nPurchase The Lord Of The Rings Theme Park Rights: This is really the last IP out there that isn't taken, and I think it would put Universal on another level. Ideally, this takes place in the new park and is the staple for that park, while Potter is staple for the others. I just think there is so much they can do here, Comcast needs to give them an offer they cannot refuse. \n\n\n\n\nSecret Life of Pets dark ride: This thing writes itself and was once a rumor that I think must come true. It needs to go into Islands Of Adventure (which I believe needs some serious help right now) and would add another solid attraction and one for kids which this park also desperately needs. \n\n\n\n\nForbidden Forrest & Ministry of Magic: I think this is what you do to end the Potter phenomena. I think both of these are such staples and as long as they keep turning out good attractions that aren't potter, it won't look like all Universal does is Potter. However, these two can just be rides and not whole lands, I cant see how this doesn't happen and doesn't work out imo. Both would be amazing queues and bring it a lot of people to the old parks once the new gate opens. \n\n\n\n\nJurassic World: Have a train at the opening gate of the new park lead them into Jurassic World just like the movie. Main attraction can be the Hamster Ball ride that was in the movie, filled with animatronics. This is one I personally really hope comes true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

How does this affect our 3 days? We could potentially do the 4 day resort package if needed.

  "title":"Strange experience on the Forbidden Journey ride?",
  "text":"So I was at Universal yesterday and something odd happened that was never explained to us. We went to the back of the line, which was supposed to be a 60 minute wait time, as a 4 without bags we got ushered into a diffrent line. We skipped the majority of the que anf were through to the ride in about 10 minutes. Now we get to the strange part. We were asked how many were in our party, we said 4 and then we were directed through a 'Staff only' door and down a long corridor and into an elevator. There was a staff member with us the entire time, but they never said anything about what was going on. We then came to a single ride carriage, we sat down and they did the usual safety checks and waited a few minutes. The carriage set off and then we carrired out the ride as usual (we have ridden the Forbidden Journey at Universal Orlando before). That was the end of the experience, we just found it very odd, especially seen as no one really explained what happened. I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on what may have happened? Thank you. \n\n\nTL;DR: Got taken through a staff only entrance to a single carriage for the Forbidden Journey and joined the ride as usaul. No one explained what happened, can you help?",

  "text":"The biggest thing that helps Universal become a major rival is Harry Potter and the upcoming Nintendo-themed area. The problem is neither are owned by Universal, and the last time Universal uses its own IPs properly was the Mummy ride. Since then, Universal began wasting its own popular IPs for mostly-screen simulator rides with little to no practical effects being used or the main focus. King Kong from Peter Jackson's version got wasted into a 3D ride, so does Despicable Me and Fast and Furious Supercharged, simulator 3D rides as well.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the House of Mouse is striking back using its own IPs like Star Wars and Marvel in order to rival Harry Potter and Nintendo at Universal theme parks. Recently, Disney uses the Avatar, which happened to be owned by Fox. The rest of the Disney parks are Disney-owned IPs and original rides, giving Disney a major advantage (as they don't share money with anyone but its own), and most of them still relies on animatronics and practical effects. It almost looks like from history, Universal would be judged with many external properties for the park's success instead of its own IPs that made the company successful in the first place.",

My GF has one and I normally buy discounted tickets through a website at work but I'm going to surprise HER and buy myself an annual pass (incredible logic, I know). My request is, what is the feedback from current pass holders.\n\n\n\n\nWhat pass do you currently have? Do you think you could better utilize a lower or higher tier pass?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you utilize the discounts often or do you find yourself using other means to experience Universal?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow important are the blackout dates? I know most are centered around Holidays but the peak times we will be going are (Feb-May and Sept-Dec).\n\n\n\n\nA little more background, she has a Preferred Pass and is probably going to upgrade to Premier because Universal is crack to some people lol. We live close but not close enough to make it an every weekend sorta thing. I'd say the max we would go a month is 1-3 days a month plus two or three weekends (a year) on property or in Orlando.\n\n\nSorry for the length and bad edits. Any insight however short is appreciated.\n\n\nUPDATE: I ended up buying the Power Pass w\/ 3 months free. Blackout dates corresponded well with already scheduled events. Went this weekend and enjoyed it without feeling rushed. Loving the AP life already lol, going again for the weekend in two weeks.",

I'm a huge Harry Potter fan and heard about some people being pushed out of line from the Forbidden Journey oversize concerns and not fitting. I'm not necessarily worried about weight wise but height wise: I'm 6' 7\" and weigh 270 pounds and pretty much all legs (I wear a size 17 shoe). Should I be okay to ride Forbidden Journey and what about the other rides in the park? Oh and I'm also going to Disney World after Universal. So any info is appreciated.\n\n\nI also recently heard about the recent rumored new HP coaster that will replace Dragon Challenge and I'm now having some second thoughts about going. Would it be worth waiting? Of course, I guess there's always the opposite end of that spectrum where you'll always be waiting for new rides and never go I guess.\n\n\nAnd lastly any big tips about Universal in general or \"must do\"? I'm definitely going to be getting a wand from Olivanders if not for the experience. Also, I'm not the biggest coaster fanatic so definitely won't be riding anything crazy like the Hulk.\n\n\nThanks for the replies!",

Does the express pass work for the full 3 days? Any information or recommendations would be very helpful!",

It's likely this will be the only time we get to go to Universal Studios (or at least the only time without kids in tow), so we want to make sure we'll experience everything. We're going to be going to the park on Thursday 27 September - is getting the Express Ticket worth it for that date? Express Ticket seems like a really good deal in that it guarantees that you get to see everything, but if the crowds are likely to be fairly minimal that day so the Express deal is only saving us a few minutes per ride, is it worth it? Anyone got any advice? We do plan to go on pretty much every ride and show, and the park is only open 8 hours - I figure that once we factor in lunch, the lengths of shows and travel between areas, its likely to be cutting it quite fine.

I don\u2019t know what has me more euphoric... the thought of Butterbeer on Turkey day, or the fact that this will be the first Thanksgiving in EIGHTEEN YEARS that I haven\u2019t hosted the family soir\u00e9e. Hmmm... still pondering that one. Haha...\n\n\nThe hubby and I have been married for 23 years, and we\u2019ve got three sons ranging in age from 14 to 22. The oldest is graduating college in December and the middle will be graduating high school in May. Next year, who knows where everyone will be?? (Who am I kidding... everyone will be at the house, waiting for me to stuff the turkey and berry the crans...) But this year, we will be enjoying the family\u2019s first real vacation since the hubs got back from his 2016 tour in Afghanistan. \n\n\nThis Thanksgiving will mark exactly two years since he\u2019s been back, and we never really celebrated his return. You know.. because life and stuff. But I can\u2019t think of many ways better than this to really enjoy his being here with us. It\u2019ll also be one short month before my 45th bday (on Christmas Eve, so that\u2019s awesome).  \n\n\nAw man... all that being said... we\u2019ve got the express pass, we have the hotel room, and we\u2019ve got the park to park 4 day pass. And, now that we\u2019ve robbed Peter to pay Potter (so to speak!), what can we do to get the most bang for our Gringotts buck?? \n\n\nAre there any military perks, other than the discounted tickets? (Not being greedy at all, but military discounts really do help, and we need all the help we can get!) We did spring for the express dining for three days, but I\u2019m not sure what Keto-y goodness I can eat out there. It doesn\u2019t matter much to me... I\u2019ve been low-carbing it for over a year now, so it\u2019s more about the kids than anything. \n\n\nIs it worth looking for an interactive wand for all of us on amazon? I found a few that weren\u2019t too bad, and eBay had a few, too. Will they work?  Any help there would be amazing, please!! I\u2019m also looking for some Hogwarts robes so we can geek the eff out on Day 2, which is what I\u2019m affectionately calling, \u201cPottersGiving\u201d!  They look pretty pricey in the park, and I think I can maybe find some for all of us before we go. Suggestions on good robes for us first-years?\n\n\nI suffer from severe positional vertigo and motion sickness, so all the fun rides are out for me, but while the kiddos (including the 47 year old) are Hulking out and escaping from Gringotts, I\u2019m sure I can stay busy. Haha. What can I do, other than tour the castle? Any walkable places I can go on my own? \n\n\nJust being around my boys having the time of their lives is worth it, but I wouldn\u2019t mind finding my own bit of magic, as well. I\u2019m sure my wand (wherever I get it) and I will have a blast, but what else can I do on my own? \n\n\nAny suggestions y\u2019all might have will be so greatly appreciated. I want this trip to be the most incredible few days we\u2019ve ever experienced. I want to make this even more amazing than I know it can be. \n\n\nThank you all in advance for your advice and suggestions!!!",

And how much would this be? Would this be based on a 1 day ticket or in the above case 2 day (assuming only 4 days and not the 5th)?

It could also be that we have been there at least once a year since 2014.  This trip is 5 days\n\n\nWe have a flight for the family to leave on Saturday morning that puts us arriving at Royal Pacific around noon.   We will check the small one's booster seat and get a Lyft once we arrive at MCO to take us to the resort.    Check in, check our bags with guest services until our room is ready (they will call or text us when the room is ready) and we will head off to Islands to do some Suessland stuff for a few hours.   Once the room is ready, we will head back and I will grab an Uber down to the Publix at Dr Phillips, load up on some snacks, water (it is so important to start over hydrating at least a week before your summer trip) and milk\/cereal for breakfast in the room all week.   Grab another Uber back to the resort and meet up with the family and spend the rest of the evening chilling by the pool.  The rest of the trip is the easiest part.  Pick a park and go.  Nothing to reserve, nothing to plan.  No need to have a ride plan or reserve specific rides at specific times, just go.

  "text":"The Jurassic World ride was severely underwhelming. A few comments:\n\n\n-When you enter the gates, any sense of awe and wonder is take away by the contained walls. I agree the Mososaurus screen effect was kind of cool, but it felt so enclosed.\n\n\n-After that scene, the ride basically stays the same as the old ride until the lift hill??? There are only TWO dinosaurs and MORE concrete walls for this first half of the ride. Literally nothing happens which is pretty sad.\n\n\n-Once we get to the lift hill, all the screens appear with Chris Pratt, which was fine, but my god less screens more dinos please.\n\n\n-Now once you enter the \u201cTyrannosaurus Kingdom\u201d the story makes even less sense. What is this place? An enclosed forrest where the T-Rex and some ither dinos live? Do these dinos not get any sunlight? Before, this building used to be an emergency water main where the dinos have taken over, and our boar escapes. Now its an indoor dino forrest? Where are we?? I might be nitpicking, but story is everything when it comes to dark rides.\n\n\nSURE, the Indominus Rex and Blue animatonics were really cool. Sure, the inside forrest looked cool. But COOL is not enough anymore. From closing down the original Jurassic Park Ride and getting THIS? This is straight up disrespectful. \n\n\nWe have amazing new rides like Hagrid\u2019s Magical Creatures and Foribidden Journey, Shanghai Pirates of the Carribean and Tron.

  "text":"Who wouldn\u2019t love this? \n\n\nIn Harry Potter, the students eat in a dinner hall with long tables and a stage at the front. You could divide the dining guests up in to the four houses, determined by which of the four rows of tables they are seated. If you\u2019ve ever been to Medieval Times, you\u2019ll understand what I\u2019m talking about, how they divide their audience to cheer for different knights depending on their seating arrangement. The Hogwarts dining hall seems perfectly set up for a similar function!\n\n\nWhile appetizers are served, an actor who plays the part of Dumbledore or another professor could welcome everybody and give a rundown of what to expect. Then during the main course, some actors could perform and maybe even get the guests involved to compete for house points which are tallied, and a winner is announced during the desert course.\n\n\nThe dining hall could have display screens set on the ceiling to replicate what we see in the movies, where candles float above their heads as they eat, and then it could get dark when Voldemort shows up, etc. I would like to think you could even have a trained owl or two fly across the room, but there are probably health code restrictions for that, hah! I\u2019m sure that many guests would even come dressed for the occasion, wearing their adorable wizard capes.\n\n\nThey could do two shows a day, one at 4:00 to 5:30 and another at 7:00 to 8:30, giving guests 30 minutes before the park typically closes to vacate the area. You could probably charge $50 or more per-person and be fully-booked all year long. I could see Universal Studios easily turning a profit with such an attraction, but maybe it wouldn\u2019t be worth the fuss for them.\n\n\nWhat do you think?

Our thought is we will explore other parts of the park after we\u2019ve done about all there is to do at the HP sections.   I will definitely make her spend and hour or so in the Simpson\u2019s area.  \n\n\nFew questions.  \n\n\nFirst, in the middle of January will we need express passes if our goal is only to ride everything in the HP areas?  Any other rides we get to are bonus (and she doesn\u2019t do coasters so will be focused on the other interactive type rides.)\n\n\nSecond, I will crush some burgers and typical amusement park food, and she will too during the day, but she likes veggie and more healthy\/upscale options.  If there\u2019s unique (non chain type) restaurant idea for dinner in the evenings in the Orlando area I\u2019d appreciate it.\n\n\nAnd finally, my first and only visit to Universal was in 1995.  I can\u2019t believe Wikipedia claims the ET ride is still there but I\u2019m curious if that is virtually the only thing left from the early 90s.  Anything else I should look to for a bit of nostalgia?",

(For example, could I win the lottery and my friend lose it? Or is it like you win the lottery per reservation instead of per person)\n\n\n Does it cost extra to enter the lottery or is it free? Like, you basically enter the lottery for free and if you win your prize is entering the crowded attraction?? Or do you have to buy the full priced USJ ticket and then enter the lottery and if you lose it you basically have to go but won't be able to enter the attraction you want to go to (I truly only really care about Super Mario world... )\n\n\n Thanks in advance ;)",

  "text":"Ladies and gentlemen, the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for is this summer! But, you all knew that already. Why not raise our expectations to an unnecessarily high point while talking about Nintendo at our favorite theme parks! Actually, that\u2019s a bad idea. Lower your expectations, everyone, but still talk about Nintendo at our favorite theme parks. \nWait! What if that disease spreading around the world delays the grand opening of Super Nintendo World?!\n\n\nLet\u2019s ignore whatever text was in that strikethrough. I think the moderators will have to make sure everyone stays on-topic in case they all read the text I struck through. \nI should post about that scary realization later.\n\n\nAnyway, speaking of on-topic, there are some things we all hope to see from Nintendo when they arrive at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Orlando Resort including plans for additional Nintendo IP to appear at the park as rides and\/or characters (The Legend of Zelda and Pok\u00e9mon would be everyone\u2019s obvious choices, but Animal Crossing, Kirby and even Splatoon and Fire Emblem are on my list). Personally, I wonder if Luigi will interact with characters from the Universal Monsters franchise much to his dismay (but only at Universal Studios Hollywood unless the rumors about Universal\u2019s Epic Universe at Universal Orlando Resort are true). Luigi could even interact with some of the Warner Bros. characters like Beetlejuice and all 5 members of Mystery Inc. from Scooby-Doo if agreements are made (as a bonus).\n\n\nI think there\u2019s some problems with my way of thinking. There a lot of pipe dreams in my head (more than there are Warp Pipes in the Mushroom Kingdom, which says a lot as Warp Pipes are abundant), but we\u2019re supposed to be discussing hopes and dreams. Although, there are other rumors saying Super Nintendo World will be located in the Lower Lot area of Universal Studios Hollywood, and if true, it probably will prevent certain interactions with other Park characters from happening. Oh well. It\u2019s still too early to for any of my dreams to come true (as the \nenemy\n theme park company claims that\u2019s something they will do); Universal Studios Japan is running out of time to tell us more information, meanwhile!\n\n\nBy the way, If Fire Emblem comes to the parks, angry Super Smash Bros. fans could intentionally do something that gets put on a Wikipedia article titled \u201cList of Incidents at Universal Parks & Resorts\u201d or whatever it\u2019s called.\n\n\nAll right, enough of striking through text, I want to hear from \nyou all\n now.

  "title":"My Pitch for Pokemon Land",
  "text":"With Super Nintendo World \ngetting more and more fleshed out\n by the day, it\u2019s getting much more likely that Pokemon may soon be coming to Universal Parks. Especially since they\u2019ve already \nreserved an area\n much bigger than the Mario Land, as an expansion zone for Super Nintendo World. So why exactly is it likely that Pokemon may soon take its place right next to Super Italian and Donkey Kong?   \n\n\n(Context: This was originally an outling for a Youtube video I was supposed to make, but it didn't fit my channel's theme)\n\n\nWhy The Pokemon Is Strong Enough\n\n\n\n\nHighest Grossing Media Franchise\n\n\nBeats Star Wars, MCU, and Harry Potter in Merch sales\n\n\nThese Franchises also have their own themed lands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best thing you can sell to an adult is a return to their childhood. \n\n\nBonus: An \nAnalogy\n of Nintendo and Pokemon's Relationship\n\n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nThe Past Pokemon Land Called PokePark\n\n\n\n\nThe 2005 PokemonPark\n in Japan\n\n\nThe History in a Youtube Video\n\n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nAttraction Concepts\n\n\n\n\nPokemon Safari Adventure\n\n\nA 4D theater experience similar to the \nNemo and Friends SeaRider\n in Tokyo DisneySea or \nStar Tours\n which could be found in most Disney Parks. \n\n\nThe Ride starts with the amphibious vehicle going underwater and navigating the caves to reach the Seafloor, where you\u2019ll encounter Deep Sea Pokemon like Relicanth and Jellicent. You then ascend to either a Reef, a Ship, or a Cold Ocean. You head for the beach and depending on what scene you just experienced, would either be a Sandy Beach, a Stone Beach, or a Cold Beach.  A Warm Beach would lead to the Jungle and the Desert, A Stone Beach would lead to a Forest and a Meadow, while a Cold Beach would lead to a Taiga and a Dragon Cave. You\u2019re later forced to fly back to the Ocean depending on your route with Mew and Mewtwo flying with you in the Warmer Climates, The Lake Trio in the Temperate Climates, and Articuno in the Colder Climates. The ride then dives into the water and takes you back to the Ocean biome you entered in and back into the docking bay.  \n\n\nThis ride plays with the rider\u2019s childhood dream of seeing Pokemon in the wilds of the real world, and thus it\u2019s essential to fully immerse the guest as much as possible in each biome. It can even be as simple as a Jellicent clinging onto the Ride Vehicle, or a Rhydon Charging into the vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n\n\nPokemon World Tournament\n\n\nTo bring this experience to us they\u2019ll need to use Live actors like in \nWater World\n, and Special Effects like AR, Animatronics, and Practical effects. \n\n\nI\u2019m kind of disappointed that we weren\u2019t able to see a full Pokemon battle in the Detective Pikachu movie, and this attraction will definitely scratch an itch for people who share the same sentiment. \n\n\nNow the roster of trainers that live actors may portray, should include fan favorites like Red, Blue, and Cynthia, with the other characters being available for actors that don\u2019t match the appearances of the three. \n\n\nOf course they need to let the fans take pictures with the actors in cosplay to get that sweet free marketing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n\n\nRayquaza\u2019s Delta Stream\n \n\n\nA similar ride has existed before as a \nkiddy coaster in PokePark\n, but the Delta Stream I envision is an inverted Roller Coaster similar to the \nBattlestar Galactica Cylon\n Coaster in Universal studios Singapore. \n\n\nThe Goal of the ride being to make older guests feel as if they\u2019re \nriding on the back of Rayquaza\n, with the ride queue bearing similarities to Sky Pillar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n\n\nWailmer Bay\n \n\n\n\n\nSimilar to \nAquatopia\n in Tokyo DisneySea, this family friendly ride can be enjoyed by both adults and children. It\u2019s a relaxing ride that would be great for older guests seeking to calm down after riding the Delta Stream, but also being a great ride for children to simply have fun in. \n\n\nThe ride basically has guests ride around the Wailmers that are relaxing around the bay, with mists sprayers mimicking blowholes for guests attending the park in the summertime, to cool off with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDitto\u2019s Hide and Seek\n\n\n\n\nLike the \nMonsters Inc ride\n in Japan, you\u2019ll use your Flashlight to mark which Pokemon in the ride are actually a disguised ditto. The ride should be enjoyable for all ages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n\n\nPokelab Round up\n \n\n\nA ride similar to \nToy Story Mania\n, that has you return all the Pokemon a mischievous Gengar released into the lab, back into their Pok\u00e9balls. This ride acts as another family friendly ride, that\u2019s designed to be fun for all ages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nPark Merchandising\n\n\n\n\nThey already have the Pokemon Center Store, but can build an actual Poke Mart or Pokemon Center in the Park.\n\n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nDining and Snack Concepts\n\n\n\n\nBattle Cafe (Table Service)\n\n\nNow for restaurants we can take the Battle Cafe from Pokemon Sword and Shield, and flesh it out using the \nPokemon Cafe\n at one of the Tokyo Pokemon Centers. \n\n\nBut unlike the Tokyo Pokemon Center Cafe, it\u2019s interior would have an animatronic Milcery and Alcremie similar to the moving shop displays in Diagon Alley. \n\n\nThey can even sell pastries like Malasadas, Lava Cookies, and Poke Puffs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCamper Curry (Take Out)\n\n\nIf you\u2019re more into absorbing the scenery of the land however, Camper Curry would be just the place for you. It\u2019s basically a camping truck that sells curry that you can find in game. On the side of course would be tables to sit on that have the atmosphere of camping out like in the Sword and Shield games. Thus the atmosphere of the land is important to the dining experience of the guest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIce Cream Cart\n\n\nVanillite Shaped Soft Serve\n\n\nAlcremie Ice Cream\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopcorn Cart\n\n\nNow for Food Carts, Popcorn buckets like the ones at Disneyland have this collectibility aspect to them and can be another source of revenue. They can even come in flavors inspired by Pokemon Typings. Like Strawberry for Fairy Types, and Chili Cheese for Fire Types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Game Vending Machine Drinks\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\n\nOak's Lab\n\n\nJust like Ollivanders in Harry Potter World, you\u2019ll choose your starter, and the participant will then battle an actor that acts as their rival. The battle can be AR or special effects and when the show is over you may opt to buy the Plushie of your starter at discount\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet and Greets\n\n\nNow for Character meet and greets, we could easily have people in Pikachu costumes, but an alternative could also be a shoulder mounted Pikachu animatronic, that perches on an actor\u2019s shoulder similar to Ash and his Pikachu. Rowlett could also be an alternative as this little owl is also popular with guests.\n\n\nA Charizard costume is also possible, as is a Greninja Animatronic or puppet. \n\n\nGengar also works well as a costumed actor and is another viable option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRotom Show\n\n\nAn actor tries to sell us Rotom Appliances kinda like a magic show way. Like he invites guests to come up on stage so Rotom can prank them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaiko Drums that Summon Tornadus, Thunderus, or Landorus\n\n\nNight Shows\n\n\nPrimal Awakening\n\n\nA boat bearing a Groudon animatronic appears and audiences on his side witness a bright yellowish light behind Groudon. Guests on Kyogre\u2019s side however, experience mist sprayed at them to contrast Groudon\u2019s Light. The main event of the light, sound, and water show occurs, as they showcase their signature moves like Precipice Blades, Origin Pulse, Eruption, and Water Spout. Eventually Rayquaza as either a Projection or Animatronic appears to calm them both down, and ending the show.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nightmare of Darkrai (Halloween Only)\n\n\nDuring Halloween Darkrai summons Ghost Pokemon to bring a night show. The show ends with Cresselia showing up to banish Darkrai.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Areas\n\n\n\n\nPoke stops and Gym for Pokemon Go\n\n\nPokemon Animatronics you can interact with using an app you can download.\n\n\n\n\nHalloween\n\n\n\n\nWill act as a Safe Haven for those unwilling to participate in Halloween Horror Nights\n\n\nDisney dominates family friendly Halloween Experiences, but Pokemon may be used to compete.\n\n\nRide overlays for Halloween, like a Haunted Mansion Trip in safari explorers can be done.",

  "text":"I am going to Universal Orlando Studios for the first time this week! I'm super excited to go but I've become extremely frightened about the 2 intense rides: Rip-Ride Rock it and the Hulk.\n\n\nI'm especially more scared of rip-ride rock it because I hate the feeling of the \"drop\" whenever going down. I've been trying to prepare myself by watching the roller coaster's POV but I always get anxious, slight shortness of breath, and I develop sweaty hands\/feet whenever I think about it. \n\n\nI feel extremely bad if I don't go on it because I feel like I am missing out sometimes. I'm afraid I will pass out on it. I want to focus on having fun on scary roller coasters but I seem to hold my breath on the scary parts and am just hoping the ride ends (my significant other says \"I need to let it out\" but I can't seem to scream in general). \n\n\nAs a little context, I used to like rides when I was younger but as I got older (24+), I think I've gotten more anxious and scared of things. Oddly, when I was younger, I went on a lot of roller coasters where it goes up high and drops down (like Doctor Doom's Fearfall). Honestly, I don't know why I go on those before because I don't find those enjoyable at all. Also, I've experienced the drop at Jurrasic Park's ride (in Hollywood) two years ago and I absolutely hated it because I thought it was steep and I was going to fall off (so I'm pretty much a baby now sigh). \n\n\nI would appreciate it if you guys had any advice on roller coaster jitters for highly anxious people? \nAm I missing out if I do not go on the ride? Are there other rides that are extremely fun where I can go on multiple times and don't have to go on these 2 intense rides? \nHow do you focus on having fun instead of anxiety\/nervous\/scaredness (I've always suffered from this even besides rollercoasters)?\n\n\nThank you so much for your time!! I appreciate any advice given!! (Feel free to go in-detail about the ride spoilers, I definitely do not mind!)",

If you upgrade from Gold to Platinum though, does it extend the length of the pass?\n\n\nThe Gold Pass covers the standard parking lot, but can you pay extra to park in the others when you arrive?\n\n\n\n\nAlso, when the park closes at 6PM are the shops still open a bit later like at Disney? Can you hang around until 7PM or so?",

In fact, most of the info I've found of this show comes from \nthis thread\n.\n\n\nThis show lasted from 1997 to 2000 until it was replaced by the Rugrats Magic Adventure show (2000-2001), followed by Shrek 4D (2003-2017) and currently the DreamWorks Theater (Since 2018).\n\n\nThis video is about 10 minutes and was recorded on June 18, 1998. It includes a Stick Stickley intro, the ice cream sundae slide, a Rugrats game, the WWYD? pie pod, a Good Burger game, an audience member getting slimed & the last minute or so or the show. It's a lot of clips, so expect some jump cuts.\n\n\nI have 3 other UHS clips I've backed up and can also upload. All are from April 1994 and includes the entire ET Adventure ride, 10-15 minutes of the Beetlejuice revue (From like the center of the 5th-10th row) and a good chunk of the Backlot tour.\n\n\nEnjoy and \"be sure to watch Nickelodeon!\"",

The Tram is always fun but also seems to have gotten a bit worse than I remember (much of the sets are now ignored from driving through  or in bad shape!)\n\n\nWaterworld is great but has very limited showings, the only other show is the animal one which isn't exactly something to watch over and over.

Here is how it went. \n\n\nParking was a breeze, used park entrance parking pass. Tried to upgrade to a last minute non private VIP tour after seeing the crowds. They told us there was an available slot so after waiting there for almost 45 minutes they told they oversold and apologized. Tried to send us on our way but I brought up they inconvenienced us and could have rode at least 2 attractions so they provided us a continental breakfast and free lanyards. That was nice of them. It was all down hill from there. \n\n\nLines lines lines everywhere we went. For everything! I have gone in peak season before but have not ever seen lines like this. Got virtual que for Life of pets, highly recommend the ride even though it broke down 2 times while riding. Took about 20 minutes to get through que. \n\n\nFlight of the Hippogriff walk on for Express\n40 minutes regular line \n\n\nForbidden Journey 30 minutes to get to locker area. After that we got in line for ride, on in about 5 minutes \n60 minutes regular line \n\n\nBacklot tour 10 minute wait \n60 minute regular wait \nThey do skip over some parts that are on the tour usually, didn\u2019t really mind but noticed that some parts of the tour were skipped over completely. \n\n\nAfter heading back up after the tour I just wanted a water and Diet Coke and this is where we started to notice the insane lines. We stepped into the simpsons line while my husband went to get some drinks. The line stretched all the way to Kwik Mart. He returned after 10 minutes, our line barley moved. We were in the express line for 45 minutes! Regular wait was over 100 minutes. This was around noon. Upper lot was getting crazy so we decided to head to lower lot. On the second elevator down you could see the sea of people below, we almost turned back but headed down anyway. \n\n\nHeaded to get the kids something to eat but everywhere we looked was line, long line, and longer line. I saw a churro stand where there was no one in line, so I ran over and the girl said 10 more minutes till they are ready. Paid her for 2 and told her I\u2019ll be right back after we ride transformers. Transformers express wait 25 minutes. Regular wait 75 minutes. Came out and it was even more crowded as before. Grabbed my churros and headed to City Walk to grab a real meal. This was the smartest move we made all day and I highly recommend. We waited maybe 30 minutes at Antijitos and everything we order was delicious! Grabbed dessert at Menchies then. headed back into the park. Absolute Mayhem! \n\n\nThis was around 230, caught the Animal Actors show and the show was full. Sitting shoulder to shoulder just like before and no one around really wearing mask. Their choice to do so, but I know that the ratio was way more people not wearing a mask than wearing one. Went back down to lower lot to finish off Jurassic Park and Mummy. JP we waited 40 minutes regular wait was almost 3 hours. Awesome ride btw! Then went over to Mummy 1 hour wait and 3 hours in regular line. After this headed back to Hogsmeade grabbed a butter beer rode Forbidden Journey then heard out at 5. There were so many people still entering the park at that time I was so glad to be leaving. Overall my experience was the worst I have ever had at any theme park EVER. Would not recommend, save your money and hop over to Disney instead! If you can secure a reservation, but that\u2019s a whole other post. HA! Hope this helps someone decide wether they go or skip. I\u2019d say SKIP for now, they are also secretly understaffed.",

We spent most of our day walking like penguins bc of the sheer amount of people in the park. It was funny when we left they had a staff member asking people if it was fun as they exited.

I'm sure they have the rights to them just like they do in Florida. That would add a timeless IP to the park. They sell Dr Suess merch and have Grinchmas annually.

I have been to Disneyland in Anaheim literally dozens of times since then, and feel like I am an expert at that park, but feel completely lost when it comes to planning this kind of trip. Being an expert for the other park, I know there can be a lot of tricks that come with being an expert in a park.\n\n\nMy question is this: anyone who is well versed in Universal Hollywood: what kind of advise would you give to someone with virtually zero idea what they are getting themselves in to? I am planning on taking my son with me for a single day, probably sometime in late May or very very early June. Are there certain rides we should go to first? Should we be worried about having enough time to get to all the rides in a single operating day? Are there any tips on choosing the right day during the week? Are there \"must eat\" snacks\/restaurants? Any other random hints that come to mind at all for what we need to know?",

  "title":"What makes Jurassic Park: The Ride the perfect adaptation?",
  "text":"&#x200B;\n\n\nWelcome to Jurassic Park\n\n\nIt's hard to imagine what Universal would be without Jurassic Park: The Ride. Located in two of the five Universal parks (the former Hollywood Location being themed to Jurassic World back in 2019, and Singapore's ride being completely different, but we'll get there later), Jurassic Park: The Ride, or Jurassic Park River Adventure, is an experience often imitated but never duplicated. It's the ride that makes you feel like you've stepped into the movies truly. When I think of the statement, \"Ride the movies,\" this is the ride that always comes to mind first. But, what makes the ride so good and the perfect adaptation of such a franchise? Well, let's figure that out today. Hold on to your butts.\n\n\nHISTORY\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nThe Raft Scene from the Jurassic Park novel\n\n\nIn 1990, the late Michael Crichton published his groundbreaking science fiction novel, Jurassic Park, and inspired American filmmaker Steven Spielberg to develop a film based around the novel, and also an attraction that would bring theme park lovers to the likes of Universal as opposed to Disney up in Anaheim. The ride would adapt the scene in which Dr. Grant and the kids are pursued in a raft by the Tyrannosaurus, as opposed to the land cruiser tour from earlier. The ride was set to be developed before the movie even began development, but was put on hold until the release of the 1993 blockbuster.\n\n\nThe poster from the movie\n\n\nThe film is not only, in my opinion, Universal Pictures' best movie to date, but also my all time favorite horror film. The movie received positive reviews from critics, and grossed over a billion dollars at the box office. This gave Universal Creative the full greenlight to adapt the movie into a ride.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nEntrance to the former Hollywood location\n\n\nWith the movie released, Universal Creative had ideas with what they were able to work with. Utilizing Stan Winston's distinct designs for the dinosaurs, the latest cutting edge theme park technology, and a special new ride system, the ride was fully developed and opened by 1996. Not only was the ride well received, but quickly became a fan favorite. To get an idea of what the ride was like in its heyday, take a look at the link here: \nJurassic Park: The Ride 1997 Hollywood\n\n\nThe ride was a classic among theme park goers, and it was obvious that it didn't need to be a Hollywood exclusive. Orlando had to get one as well. Initially planned for where Men in Black: Alien Attack is today, Universal Creative opted for the attraction to be placed in it's owned themed area in the second park at the Orlando Resort, Islands of Adventure.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nEntrance to the land at Islands of Adventure\n\n\nFlorida's ride would be relatively similar, but would include some minor differences to keep the attraction fresh. At almost 25 years old, the attraction still operates today. Here is a video of the Florida ride: \nJurassic Park River Adventure Orlando\n\n\nWith America having two versions of the ride operating, when Universal went over to Japan, Jurassic Park was one of the rides they cloned, opening with the park in 2001.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nThe ride at Universal Studios Japan\n\n\nThe ride is an identical clone of the Orlando ride, with two major differences. The first is that it is mirrored, and the second is that it's in Japanese. It is by far the best looking of the rides, and it's crisp quality can be viewed in this POV right here: \nJurassic Park: The Ride Japan\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nI might as well bring up Singapore's version, because, it's kind of hard not to at this point. In 2010, Universal Studios Singapore opened, and with it came a Jurassic Park attraction of its own, but it is a much different ride, seeing as how it is a rapids attraction, similar to Grizzly River Run or Kali River Rapids at the Disney Parks, but with dinosaurs and John Williams music.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nEntrance to the Singapore ride\n\n\nHere is the video of that attraction: \nJurassic Park Rapids Adventure Singapore\n\n\nNow, it's time for the billion dollar question once again. What makes Jurassic Park: The Ride the perfect adaptation? Well, I guess we should take a look at the ten reasons why this is the case. So let's get into that.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n10.\n\n\nThe story fully incorporates guests into the world\n\n\nEntrance at the former Hollywood attraction\n\n\nA lot of theme park attractions involve you into the stories of the world's adapted from movies. Rides like Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance at the Disney Parks get credit for this, but I feel like Jurassic Park doesn't get enough credit. I mean, the story's idea is that several new Jurassic Parks are built after the disastrous failure of Isla Nublar in 1993. So, John Hammond's idea of reintroducing the dinosaur parks in other parts of the world other than the tropical setting, with new safety features to ensure what happened at Nublar won't happen again. For the Florida and Japan rides, they've got entire themed lands, essentially new Jurassic Parks in their own regards, whereas Hollywood only got the ride. But, I digress. The story smartly fits within the timeline of the movie and feels like you've stepped into the billion dollar franchise.\n\n\n9.\n\n\nThe idea for a river adventure is genius\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nBoat at Islands of Adventure\n\n\nNow, I know Jurassic Park's tour in the movie featured the land cruiser, and the ride was originally going to incorporate the land cruiser into an attraction, but it was later decided to make it a water attraction sometime in its development, and I have to say, that is one of the smartest ideas ever made by Universal Creative, as not only does a boat ride make it feel like you've stepped into the famous movie, and it genuinely feels like a ride John Hammond oversaw in the development of his theme park. Singapore, as I said, is a rapids attraction, so the boats there are rafts, and they also look like a real attraction developed by John Hammond's team, just not as much as the boats from the other parks.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nRaft in Singapore\n\n\nIf you ever feel like you want to step inside of the real Jurassic Park, the fact that the ride is on water adds to the experience.\n\n\n8.\n\n\nThe animatronics still feel real\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nThe Ultrasaurus at the beginning of the ride\n\n\nTo me, animatronics heighten the experience of an attraction. Jurassic Park is no different. The ride includes so many animatronics of so many dinosaurs, included in the movies or not. The best and most complex of the animatronics (the iconic T-Rex at the end of the ride) still gives everyone goosebumps no matter where on Earth you experience the ride. Despite being over 20 years old, the animatronics still have functions that make them feel like you are genuinely next to the creatures of 65 million years ago, which, in my book, is one of the best things you can do with a ride like this.\n\n\n7.\n\n\nJohn Williams' score\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nThe movie's score\n\n\nJohn Williams made several movies iconic with his scores. Jaws, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, ET, Hook, and of course, Jurassic Park. Universal, of course, had to incorporate the iconic score from that  movie made the movie extra iconic. The music adds to the ambience of the Jurassic Park areas at the parks, and during the ride, you feel an extra sense of whimsy during the opening scene, and a sense of urgency when in the scarier section of the ride. The only part where the score fluctuates is in Japan, when, for some reason on the lift, they utilize music from The Mummy from 1999, which totally breaks the flow of the ride. Why not include some music from the movie's soundtrack on the lift? Take notes USJ for your next refurbishment. Other than that minor nitpick, the score totally adds to the experience of the ride.\n\n\n6.\n\n\nIt doesn't hold back with the scare factor\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nThe turning point of the ride at the former Hollywood location\n\n\nAbout half way through the ride, it goes from a tranquil journey through the world of the dinosaurs into a frightening experience, with the plant eating dinosaurs taking a back seat, and the real beasts come out to play. Within the Raptor Containment Area, you encounter the likes of the venom spitting Dilophosaurus, to the terrifyingly clever Velociraptors, and of course, the biggest and scariest of all, the Tyrannosaurus Rex (but we'll get there in a minute). Not only that, your only area of escape is a 84 1\/2 foot (death defying) drop from the indoor section into society. If that's not frightening, I don't know what is.\n\n\n5.\n\n\nSuttle ties to the movie within the ride\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nThe falling Ford Explorer at the former Hollywood location\n\n\nHollywood's location did have a lot more ties to the movie than the other rides, so I will mention that the Raptor Containment Area contains a very impressive recreation of the Raptor Pen from the movie, as do the other versions (minus Singapore's), but Hollywood had a very impressive tie to the movie, featuring the custom Ford Explorer from the movie, but it is tipping over the edge (much like the movie), before eventually, it loses its balance, falls over the edge and plummets into the water, narrowly hitting the guests. Sure, the effect never really worked correctly, seeing as how Florida used a falling Raptor pen as opposed to the land cruiser, but when it did work, it always reminded guests of the scene from the movie, not to mention the Barbasol can towards the end (I see what you did there). While Florida contains a recreation of the visitors center, utilizing the actual screen used fossil props from the movie, which is pretty awesome, the sutler ties always make me smile.\n\n\n4.\n\n\nFunny jabs\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nMickey goes to Universal?!\n\n\nIn Hollywood's location, the funniest thing about the ride was the easter egg of a Mickey Mouse Hat floating in the water, as a jab to Disneyland in Anaheim. According to some sources however, there was a running joke that the name of the current ride's operations manager was stitched into the hat. It's kinda funny seeing this easter egg, despite the fact that this whole idea was completely abandoned. Maybe bring this back at the other parks, because it always makes me laugh.\n\n\n3.\n\n\nOften imitated, but never duplicated\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nGate at Universal Studios Hollywood\n\n\nSpeaking of Disney, in 1998, with the opening of Disney's Animal Kingdom, a dinosaur attraction of its own merits opened, simply titled Dinosaur (formerly titled Countdown to Extinction before tying it to the movie from the 2000s), and it utilizes the ride system of the Indiana Jones Adventure in Anaheim, but with dinosaurs as opposed to adventure theming. And while that attraction isn't too similar, the idea of a dinosaur lunging at you (again, we'll get there later), before a drop to escape is implemented at both attractions, as well as encounters with the beast that tries to kill you before the big ending. The Carnotaurus replaces the T-Rex here, but it's the same idea. I find it funny that the 5th film in the franchise, Fallen Kingdom, has a scene where the T-Rex fights a Carnotaurus, signifying the idea that those two are enemies, and in the theme park world, it's technically true.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n2.\n\n\nIt never felt outdated\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/r2vx24yrv0791.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3f71e27902963c05e8cfcae673b25d0f7a2e0f3c\n\n\nThe original movie, which is nearly 30 years old by the time this is posted, despite five sequels, never got tired or outdated after the fact. The same thing can be said for the ride. While the original Hollywood has been rethemed into Jurassic World (which is still pretty good), it feels pointless to retheme the attractions at the other parks. No matter how many decades pass, it won't ever feel outdated, as it continues to inspire guests and fans alike.\n\n\nAnd yes, I've held this off long enough, we all know what number one is.\n\n\n1.\n\n\nThe T-Rex is the greatest surprise in theme park history\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nThe T-Rex finale at the former Hollywood location (during the opening)\n\n\nImagine this, you are on the boat, in the dark, alarms blaring, you've had a taste of what the beast can do after watching the movie, and after a previous (yet brief) encounter at two of the locations (\nThe first (frightening) encounter with the beast\n), and you come face to face to an empty area, before the drop, and with the loud footsteps of the beast in the background, what could possibly go wrong, and then all of a sudden, the leader of the dinosaurs makes its prominent presence, and attempts to eat you. Orlando and Hollywood handle this really well. Here is the comparison of Hollywood's and Orlando's: \nThe battle of the Rexes on the east and west coast\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nWhile Singapore's version of the ride doesn't have tension whatsoever with it's encounter with the T-Rex (an elevator lifts you up and it's just there), the suspension at the other parks is still amazing and deserves to be brought up. This is exactly why the T-Rex is the greatest surprise in theme park history, and why Jurassic Park: The Ride is the perfect adaptation.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nJurassic World\n\n\nWhile Hollywood's version was rethemed to Jurassic World, and is still pretty well done (\nPOV of new Jurassic World: The Ride\n), nothing can beat the original classic attraction spearheaded by the creative team of the 1990s, and it can never be bested. Now as a special treat, you can relive the classic Hollywood attraction once again within the videos I've found here on the internet, so to conclude this tranquil journey, please enjoy this video of the original ride on its final day, and continue to ride the movies. Thank you for reading and enjoy your day.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d3ppzptiz0791.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=73f3bf6655296bada6481efda60003688c816ffe\n\n\nJurassic Park: The Ride Hollywood (ONE LAST TIME)",

We have tickets through UCT and they stated if we don't use the tickets universal is able to change them at the gate. Given that we live in Philadelphia, PA. The risk that we aren't able to exchange them once we get there is pretty high. Has anyone had any issue getting unused tickets exchanged at the gate? I called universal guest services and it's not something they can do over the phone. Any help would be great, as I am in school from august- december so we plan on going a day after i'm done with this semester.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nTLDR; Any luck with UCT tickets being exchanged after not using them for the dates given?",

We haven\u2019t been here in ages and would like to get in early at 2pm and have the express pass to be able to take advantage of the maxes at least once with little to no line (I imagine even this will have some line, no worries).\n\n\nCurrently they have the HHN After 2pm pass with no fast pass for sale online (which gives you entry to the park early and allows you to stay for the night event) and the HHN Express Fast Pass after 2pm (early entry to the park and express entries to rides and mazes) but this one is sold out online. Would I be able to upgrade my early entry with no express pass at the door to a express pass for more money, even though I cannot purchase it online right now? Granted it is late in the week to not have done it sooner but asking for clarity.\n\n\nThanks all!",

  "text":"Recently made a trip to Universal Studios Hollywood over the weekend, my group decided to just buy the Express Pass once per ride at $105 each person since we noticed it was a bit packed by the time we arrived at 10:30am. We haven't been to the park since late 90's - early 2000's so we weren't as familiar to the rides and at first we weren't sure if the express pass would be worth it. But i'm here to say it was definitely worth it! We were able to ride all the rides except for a few kids rides.\n\n\nThe longest wait we had was about 30 minutes for Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey with express pass, while without the pass it was about a 100 minute wait. Same with The Revenge of the Mummy and Jurassic Park rides, about 75 - 100 minute waits for those while we only waited about 15 minutes each.  \n\n\nUSH entry tickets are already way more expensive than Disneyland tickets, especially adding the Express Pass, however, if you can spare the extra $105 or $145 during a packed day, I would say bite the bullet and get the express passes.",

I'm really grateful that we've created a great space for people to have their travel questions answered and have a bit of fun on the side.\n\n\nWe get many new folks who come in and ask similar questions: best places to eat, how to plan the day, \"Is Express worth it?\" and such, and though there's no issue with getting a bit of help when you need it, I do wonder if these kinds of questions are a little grating to the frequent readers here, and I was wondering if an FAQ page and megathread would be helpful in this situation.\n\n\nMy main holdup with not implementing a feature sooner is the wide array of parks to cover.  If this was just Hollywood or just Orlando, this would be easy, but this subreddit is for the Asian parks, too - parks even I am not familiar with.\n\n\nTo cut to the chase, I have a few questions I'd like to hear answers for from the community.  You aren't forced answer, of course, but please consider taking a second to pitch in your ideas.  They would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\n\nWould viewers want a feature like this implemented?\n\n\nIn which format should this be implemented?  Megathread or Wiki post?  Should I prioritize Old Reddit or New Reddit, since they each have different functions?  (I'll do my best to get to both eventually.)\n\n\nShould I split megathreads for different resorts?  Have one for American parks and one for Asian parks, or have one for Hollywood, one for Orlando, and one for Asian parks?  Skip Asian parks entirely because they don't see as many questions asked about them here?\n\n\n\n\nI'll talk about sourcing data for the FAQ from the community and from Universal's websites once we've settled on a format, if one is being implemented at all.  Again, this is just in the idea phase - it won't be implemented if the readers here don't feel like they need one.\n\n\nThanks in advance for your feedback, and thank you again for being a part of the community.",

  "text":"Planning a trip for 2 adults, no kids for May next year (5\/11-5\/29) to celebrate my 40th, coming from the UK. \n\n\nFirst trip for me, husband has been as a kid\/teen 20+ years ago. \nPlan is to spend a week doing Disney then a 4-day Miami weekend followed by a week doing US\/IOA\/VB & a day in Busch Gardens. \n\n\nI have already booked a night at RP for two days worth of Express but my question is if I should splurge on the public VIP tour as well? \n\n\nMy thinking is to do it as our first day and then spend two days with Express just doing what we missed\/loved but also be able to take a midday break if needed without stressing that we are losing park time. \n\n\nI really want to feel like I have done everything I wanted as it\u2019s not likely we will be coming back anytime soon and as our last weekend falls on Memorial Day weekend I fear the weekend will be crammed so I\u2019m debating skipping the parks during the weekend and just have some cooling down time before coming back home. \n\n\nIs booking the public VIP Tour redundant with already having two park days with Express passes? \n\n\nOr is it the best way to maximise our chances of feeling that we have seen\/done everything we wanted?",

  "text":"Hello, everyone.  Please feel free to reply to this post with questions, meet-up requests, or anything else related to Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios Hollywood.  I will provide helpful links and information in this main post that will be updated as more information is released and verified.\n\n\nTo the regular park visitors and readers, please bear with me if information and source links in this post may seem obvious or oft repeated; I want to cover every base, as many visitors not familiar with the park will likely be in attendance.  Also, if I missed anything, please reply and let me know.  Thank you. :)\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\n\nUniversal Studios Hollywood's Super Nintendo World web page\n\n\nNintendo of America news article\n\n\nBuy Tickets\n\n\nReserve Pass Holder Preview time slot\n\n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nSuper Nintendo World is an area located within Universal Studios Hollywood theme park (henceforth abbreviated as USH).  It contains one attraction (Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge), one dining location (Toadstool Cafe), one main merchandise shop (1-UP Factory), character meet-ups, and interactive activities themed to the Super Mario franchise.\n\n\nSuper Nintendo World is not a separate theme park.  Any and all valid tickets and passes to Universal Studios Hollywood include access to Super Nintendo World at no extra charge.  There are no separately paid entry tickets to Super Nintendo World.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nOpening Dates, Reservations and Express Pass Compatibility\n\n\nSuper Nintendo World opens to the general public on Friday, February 17, 2023.\n  Reservations will not be required to enter the area as long as the land has not reached full capacity.  When the area reaches full capacity, \nfree reservations will be required to enter the land\n.  These can be booked on the day of your visit at one of various booths found directly east of Transformers: The Ride 3D (walk towards the attraction queue and head right before entering; the kiosks will be up against the shop's outer wall) or via the Universal Studios Hollywood mobile app.\n\n\nIf you purchased an Express pass before the day of your visit, you are granted complimentary access to the area once per day during a reservation period without a reservation (i.e. if\/when the area requires reservations but you have Express for the day, you get one walk-in without needing to book in advance).  At the time of writing Express does NOT grant you access to a priority queue for Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge (at the moment, there isn't any form of priority queue for the attraction), but an Express line will be implemented in the future.\n\n\nPass Holder Previews will be discussed lower down on this post.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nMario Kart: Bowser's Challenge\n\n\nMario Kart: Bowser's Challenge\n is the only ride in Super Nintendo World at USH.  It is an augmented reality (AR) dark ride based on the Mario Kart video game series.  Players take on the role of racers helping Team Mario defeat Team Bowser in a kart race, collecting coins and shooting shells at enemies to gain the upper hand.  Guests under 48\" in height MUST be accompanied by a height-compliant supervising companion to ride this attraction.  For more information on this attraction, click \nhere\n.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nToadstool Cafe\n\n\nToadstool Cafe is the main dining option in the area.  So far, the menu includes \nToadstool Cheesy Garlic Knots, Super Mushroom Soup, Piranha Plant Caprese, Mario Bacon Cheeseburger, Luigi Pesto Chicken Burger, ? Block Tiramisu and Princess Peach Cupcake\n.  I will update this section once I have the full menu, but it seems like many of these items were carried over from the menu of \nKinopio's Cafe in Super Nintendo World in Universal Studios Japan\n.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nPower-Up Bands & Interactivity\n\n\nPower-Up Bands are separately-sold items available for purchase within Super Nintendo Land and other retail outlets in USH and CityWalk.  These bands are snap bracelets with a watch-like face for a printed character icon and an NFC chip inside.  There are six bands, each representing a different character (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Yoshi, and Daisy).  Similar to the wands purchasable at Hogsmeade, these accessories allow guests to interact with various activity spots within the land, often minigames played by tapping the band's NFC chip against a location-specific receptor with good timing or in a specific pattern.  The context of these activities is Princess Peach's Golden Mushroom has been stolen, and guests will try to recover it.  \nBy completing all four activities (Goomba, Koopa, Piranha Plant, and Thwomp), guests will be given access to one final activity - a boss battle against Bowser Jr.\n\n\nUnlike the Hogsmeade wands, the Power-Up Bands have functionality outside the parks beyond display.  They also work as amiibo, so they will scan and function the same as amiibo figures and cards in supported games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.  Note that the Power-Up Band amiibo functionality is limited to the Nintendo Switch systems - they are incompatible with the Wii U and 3DS systems despite those older systems having support for the regular amiibo figures and cards.\n\n\nAt the time of writing, Power-Up Bands are not yet available for purchase in the US, but according to a cashier I spoke with on Dec. 18, they will be available for purchase \"before the ride opens\", though no further information was given.  I will update this page with pricing and availability when I learn and verify that information.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nPass Holder Previews\n\n\nRegistration for Pass Holder Previews opens on Thursday, Jan. 5, 2023 at 1:30p Pacific time.  Pass holders will use \nthis\n link to reserve a time slot.  Each time slot is two hours long.\n\n\nPass Holder Previews will be held on the following dates:\n\n\n\n\nSunday, Jan. 29, 2023\n\n\nMonday, Jan. 30, 2023\n\n\nTuesday, Jan. 31, 2023\n\n\nFriday, Feb. 3, 2023\n\n\nSaturday, Feb. 4, 2023\n\n\nWednesday, Feb. 8, 2023\n\n\nThursday, Feb. 9, 2023\n\n\nFriday, Feb. 10, 2023\n\n\nSaturday, Feb. 11, 2023\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in will be held in the Globe Gardens.  It's the fenced-off grassy patch between the Woody parking lot and the neon USH sign (if coming from Frankenstein parking garage, it'll be on the right.  If coming from CityWalk, it'll be on the left).  USH recommends checking in an hour before your time slot, but they also note the 10:00a-12:00p time slot begins check-in at \n8:30a\n.  Check-in tables for all time slots close at 3:00p.\n\n\nSUPER IMPORTANT\n: passholders are allowed to pick any date for their preview, so if you have successfully booked a reservation to a Pass Holder Preview on one of your blackout dates, \nyour blackout will be lifted on the day of your reservation\n.  You are free to pick any date and enjoy the rest of the park provided your reservation is valid.  However, \nif your reservation falls on what would be a blackout day, you must have proof of your reservation along with your pass to enter and exit the park at will\n.\n\n\nFor Platinum and Gold passholders attending previews, discounts will apply in the area to food and beverage ONLY (no discounts apply to Nintendo merchandise, but this rule is already in effect in all the stores, anyway).\n\n\nPass holders are allowed to reserve for a group all at once by using the same reservation session and adding multiple pass numbers to the form.  USH explicitly says that no guests without passes are allowed.  All guests must have a pass and a correctly reserved time slot to be granted access.  Reservations may be cancelled, but they cannot be transferred or changed - if you want to change your date or time slot, you must cancel your current booking and rebook a new one.\n\n\nAs discussed earlier for general guests, Express is not valid for use in Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge even during the previews.\n\n\nFor more information on the Pass Holder Previews for Super Nintendo World at USH, please click \nhere\n for preview day procedures and an FAQ.",

(I know jet lag may be an issue, but am hoping I can power through with coffee - it's the only day I can visit the park as a group Japan tour I'm doing starts the next day.) \n\n\nI see that they offer advance area entry for both Nintendo World and Harry Potter, but it looks like that advance booking is only available through specific SE Asian travel agencies, otherwise you need to reserve a time once you're physically in the park, through the app or a kiosk. My flight arrives at 7:30am so by the time I get through immigration, get to my hotel to drop my stuff, and get to the park, it'll be well after the 8:30am opening. Do you think I'm going to be SOL in getting an area entry time for those lands? I will have tickets in advance that I get through work, but don't think I'll be able to reserve timed entry with them. \n\n\nIt will not help that I'll be there on a Friday, it is Sakura season, and also apparently a Japanese school holiday that week. (Not ideal timing for a park visit haha, but it's my only option.) \n\n\nAppreciate any advice! Thank you!",

We used them one day but still have one day of use left on them. If we have pictures and forms of ID will the park replace them?

  "title":"Super Nintendo World @ USH: Passholder Preview and Extended Information",
  "text":"Hello, everyone.\n\n\nI think many would have the same question: why am I making this?  We already have a \nSNW FAQ\/Megathread\n.\n\n\nMy main reason was the main FAQ was becoming a bit much to scroll through with more and more general guest info being added, and knowing previews won't be permanent, I wanted a way to archive the preview information while keeping the main thread in tact.  Theme park history is important to me, and the present eventually becomes the past, so having record of this kind of stuff not just for guests of today to use easily, but for guests of the future to look back on whether for nostalgia or figuring out plans or making predictions for future attractions is worth my time investment (at least in my mind).\n\n\nI've also spoken to someone who's attended formal team member previews (not just general admission rehearsal days), so they provided me some more concrete details about how the event will work and some key tips to know.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nOperations and Logistics on Pass Holder Preview Days (mainly cut\/pasted stuff from the main FAQ with new stuff sprinkled in where I could fit it)\n\n\nRegistration for Pass Holder Previews opened on Thursday, Jan. 5, 2023 at 1:30p Pacific time Monday, Jan. 9, 2023 at 11:00a Pacific time. Pass holders must use\n \nthis\n \nlink to reserve a time slot.\n\n\nPass Holder Previews are now fully booked, and the link to the reservation page has been taken down.  You may still cancel at any time, but you may NOT reschedule for a different date.  There is no charge for Pass Holder previews - admission is included with your pass.  \nEach time slot will be approximately two hours long.\n  The time slots, from reports, seem to include:\n\n\n\n\n10:00a - 12:00p\n\n\n1:00p - 3:00p\n\n\n2:00p - 4:00p\n\n\n3:00p - 5:00p\n\n\n4:00p - 6:00p\n\n\n7:00p - 9:00p\n\n\n\n\nI have also had reports of guests of any ticket type being allowed in without reservations after 6:00p, but I would like to wait for more information before locking these in as facts.\n\n\nPass Holder Previews will be held on the following dates:\n\n\n\n\nSunday, Jan. 29, 2023\n\n\nMonday, Jan. 30, 2023\n\n\nTuesday, Jan. 31, 2023\n\n\nFriday, Feb. 3, 2023\n\n\nSaturday, Feb. 4, 2023\n\n\nSunday, Feb. 5, 2023\n\n\nWednesday, Feb. 8, 2023\n\n\nThursday, Feb. 9, 2023\n\n\nFriday, Feb. 10, 2023\n\n\nSaturday, Feb. 11, 2023\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in will be held next to the Globe Gardens, the fenced-off grassy patch between the Woody parking lot and the neon USH sign hidden behind some tall shrubbery (if coming from Frankenstein parking garage, it'll be on the right. If coming from CityWalk, it'll be on the left).  USH recommends checking in an hour before your time slot, but they also note the 10:00a-12:00p time slot begins check-in at 8:30a \n(though in practice, they started closer to 8:00a)\n. Check-in tables for all time slots close at 3:00p.\n\n\nWhen checking in at the Globe Gardens, guests will be given a paper wristband that corresponds to their time slot (These are NOT the Power-Up Bands.  Those are sold separately and are not included with your admission or reservation.).  Staff will be checking your wristband time slot for entry to Toadstool Cafe and Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge especially.  Guests will not be able to enter either of those two park offerings once their time slot has ended, and will not be able to play any of the key challenges up to two hours after their time slot has ended.  Please be respectful to staff and other guests when your time slot is over.\n\n\nSUPER IMPORTANT\n: passholders are allowed to pick any date for their preview, so if you have successfully booked a reservation to a Pass Holder Preview on one of your blackout dates, \nyour blackout will be lifted on the day of your reservation\n. You are free to pick any date and enjoy the rest of the park provided your reservation is valid. However, \nif your reservation falls on what would be a blackout day, you must have proof of your reservation along with your pass to enter and exit the park at will\n.\n\n\nFor Platinum and Gold passholders attending previews, discounts will apply in the area to food and beverage ONLY (no discounts apply to Nintendo merchandise, but this rule is already in effect in all the stores that sell it, anyway).\n\n\nPass holders are allowed to reserve for a group of up to 8 all at once by using the same reservation session and adding multiple pass numbers to the form\n. USH explicitly says that no guests without passes are allowed. All guests must have a pass and a correctly reserved time slot to be granted access (guests under the age of 3 are allowed to enter the land if they are accompanied by someone with a valid reservation). Reservations may be cancelled, but they cannot be transferred or changed - if you want to change your date or time slot, you must cancel your current booking and rebook a new one.\n\n\nAs discussed earlier for general guests, Express is not valid for use in Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge even during the previews.\n\n\nFor more information on the Pass Holder Previews for Super Nintendo World at USH, please click \nhere\n for preview day procedures and an FAQ.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nKey Tips to Know\n\n\nToadstool Cafe tends to fill up quickly.  As mentioned in the main FAQ (newly added), guests may not be able to enter the cafe if it hits max capacity, but will instead be given a return time to visit again later (think of this like the pre-2019 paper FastPass system at Disneyland).  The person who I spoke two who attended team member previews also mentioned supply issues with ingredients at the cafe, so popular items might sell out quickly.\n\n\nAs was the case for general admissions tech rehearsals and for some unspecified number of days\/weeks\/months after the opening ceremony, Universal Express is INCOMPATIBLE with Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge.  An Express queue will be added in the future, but there is currently no word on when.\n\n\nThe interactive elements have lines, though the Piranha Plant key challenge is deceiving because it can be done as a team (compared to Goomba and Koopa, for example, which are only done solo).  These queues, at their worst, can extend to nearly an hour long, so please be advised when trying to plan your trip.  Bowser Jr.'s battle has a line, but the queue for that activity has interactive elements within it.  Guests will not be able to enter the final game room if they don't have enough keys (or are not supervising a child who has collected enough keys).\n\n\nStamp integration for character meet-ups was NOT activated during the preview.  You can still snap a photo with any of the three characters, but you will not earn a stamp for it.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nIf you have any further questions about pass holder previews, please ask them in the replies.\n\n\nThanks to u\/TFMr_Fox for helping me out with information about these previews and the land and park operations in general, and thank you to all of the wonderful members of this community who've brought up their experiences in this thread, the main megathread, or their separate posts.  You all are helping more and more guests have better experiences when they visit, and that's awesome.",

  "title":"A bit disappointed with SNW clothing merchandise",
  "text":"Like the title says, I'm a bit disappointed with the clothes they sell at Super Nintendo World here in Hollywood. I went over the weekend and went full ham on buying merch (For context here, I am a girl). I saw the character face shirts and bought both the Bowser and Peach face shirts. I prefer shirts to be on the looser side so I got the XXL, thinking they would be much looser and would sit below my hip, as most unisex shirts do when I buy something that size.\n\n\nI tried it on this morning to wear it to work, and was shocked at the fact that both shirts did not even fit over my chest. I was so afraid the shirts would tear, that I stopped moving and tried to find a way to get the shirt off. My fiance had to help me get the shirts off. I double checked the size thinking I probably grabbed the wrong size by mistake but sure enough the shirts said XXL. Not gonna lie, my body dysmorphia kicked in hard because I thought I had gained alot of weight in a short amount of time or something, so I tried on a shirt I hadn't worn in months that's a XL and it fit loose. I really hope I'm not the only one with this experience. I'm now considering returning them when I go back, or at least, exchanging them for the biggest size they have. \n\n\nDid anyone else have trouble with the clothing sizes?

  "title":"Nitpick\/Nonsense Rant: There Are Better Questions to Ask Than \"Is It Crowded on X Day?\"",
  "text":"I write today not as a mod, but a reader with an opinion (oh no).  Some may have the same sentiment as I do, but I hope I can turn my frustration into something productive and helpful for others.\n\n\nAsking about park crowd levels is certainly an innocent question at a surface level, especially for newcomers or casuals to the theme park scene.  However, as many frequent readers probably have seen, we get this question quite a bit in the sub, and I personally find it a bit grating for a couple of reasons.\n\n\nFirstly is the aspect that different people are okay with different levels of crowds.  Obviously, the bell curve turns to unanimity on the extreme ends - an empty park is fun for nearly everyone and a shoulder-to-shoulder slog fest is the opposite of that for nearly everyone.  However, some people are okay with waiting 50 minutes for Transformers while others might find it ludicrous.  Some people are okay with a couple of pathway bottlenecks here and there while others might find all of them annoying and frustratingly stressful.  Boiling a question that requires knowledge of personal preference down to a yes\/no question is very difficult to answer properly.  It's especially more complicated when multiple people are in the same party, all of them need to know the answer to that question, but they all have different preferences.\n\n\nSecondly is the aspect that there are so many factors to crowd levels that this type of yes\/no question completely ignores in the quest for a simple answer that I believe likely won't help much in the long run.  Anything as mundane and easy to get as the weather forecast or the presence\/lack of a special\/limited-time event to as nuanced and complex as how blackout dates line up for the various different passes or the price calendar setup for general day tickets have an effect on the crowds of a given day, and not all of those factors affect the crowds equally, either.\n\n\nI know that, when people ask that question, it's never intended to sound that way and is not a reflection of what they feel or think, but it's a question that unintentionally gets me to imagine that the inquisitor really just wants a quick, easy blanket answer and hasn't really put in the thought or research to figure out what levels of crowds are comfortable for themselves.  Of course a simple answer is the desired outcome for everyone in an ideal sense, but I think in this case, more explanations and thought formed from a detailed answer are worth more than the simplicity provided in a one-word answer.\n\n\nInstead, I believe there are more constructive questions that can be asked and answered instead.  What factors can lead to increased or decreased crowd levels for a specific day or time period?  What events happen once-over that might change these established patterns?  At Orlando specifically, to what extent will something at IoA have an effect on USF, or vice versa?  These more specific questions not only allow the inquirer to find starting points for their own research should they desire to perform any, but also allow others in the comments of such posts or replies to a megathread to also do their own research or reflect on past experiences to come up with more specific advice to give the people asking.\n\n\nA similar thing can be said about \"Should I buy Express for X day?\", but the advice I think remains the same.  Express and crowds are so intertwined that the question of crowds kind of answers or provides a major insight into the question of Express.\n\n\ntl;dr I'm tired of people asking the same basic question and I wanted to provide some better starting-off points for people asking about crowd levels to better allow them to perform research and find more helpful answers than one that relies on personal preference and overgeneralization (in my eyes).",

  "title":"Opening Day - Trip Report from Me, Tips for Guests, and a Word to Park Staff",
  "text":"Yesterday was the first time I'd ever attended the formal opening day of any theme park area or attraction, and I'll definitely never forget it.  I was already excited for this because it was the crossover I'd never thought I'd see between video games and theme parks but it didn't hit until I went back home and thought about how I was able to snap a selfie with Doug Bowser, President of Nintendo of America, and another with David from the FreshBaked! theme park YouTube channel within the same little plot of land on the same day.\n\n\nI definitely think attending the Pass Holder previews made my opening day less stressful because I knew I didn't have to do everything in one day, let alone opening.  When I started the day, I already had 90 of the 128 total stamps, so my goal was just to get to 100 or more, and I cleared that goal.  Since a few of the stamps are leaderboard-based and some are seasonal, I knew I wouldn't have them all, but I want to get as close as possible as soon as possible with what time I had.\n\n\nI already knew that the main priority of the day would be meeting Mario, Luigi, and Peach... again.  The band scanner wasn't available during both previews I attended, and these would be easy stamps to get to fill out the bank since there wasn't really any challenge beyond waiting in line.  While Peach worked and I got her stamp soon after the visit, I have yet to receive Mario's and Luigi's, and I have to assume the scanner didn't work properly, so the next time I visit, I have to wait in line for them a third time (I didn't take a photo with the boys on my first preview).  Somewhat disappointing, but not the end of the world.\n\n\nI got the Top 10 Daily Score in Mario Kart stamp yesterday.  Before the ride starts, the karts get stopped in a little curved passageway where 2D art of the Koopalings and Bowser scroll past, and you get unlimited items to throw at them while you wait.  Use this time to readjust the position of the headset if you need to and get used to motion aiming.  I cannot stress this enough.  As the ride ages and some of the visors get damaged, you'll want to make this into a habit because of how the alignment of the aiming will shift slightly.  I'd already seen this happen in one of my ride throughs, where the aim was slightly coming from my left eye instead of dead-on center despite having re-adjusted the headset a few times in that 2D area.  In terms of headband placement, I personally have to put it a bit low to make sure my eyes fit the center of the visor pieces, but that helps me aim a lot better.  I just make sure the rubber forehead piece rests just above my glasses and my glasses lightly touch the red plastic visor.\n\n\nFor a Top 10 score, though, you want to jump into the land immediately and head for single-rider because your best chance at a high score is when not many people have been on the attraction yet early in the day.  Not many people knew about single-rider yesterday, since there are zero signs for it and team members didn't point this out.  Once you enter the pipe to the attraction and land in the pink Yoshi's Island room (right before the cave room), make a HARD right.  You'll see a dummy test kart and a passageway that looks more like Super Mario 3D World's underground than Yoshi's Island.  That's your single-rider queue.  Keep in mind that it skips a LOT.  You'll miss 90-95% of the detail in the queue, though you'll be blessed with a great view of the area and one of the fastest line skips in the park.  For me, it turned a 90-minute wait into a 10-minute one, but YMMV.  I've seen the single-rider queue stretch to Bowser's Castle's exterior once people learned about it throughout the day, making it maybe a 30 minute wait?\n\n\nI got a no-damage run in Bowser Jr. Shadow Showdown yesterday, which was more luck than anything.  The rules of the game are pretty clear, but this was the first time the motion detector got my shadow well-calibrated.  I didn't get a Top 10 score, but since I'm a passholder, I've come up with a strategy for next time - collect three keys before I leave, then on the next visit, hop into Bowser Jr.'s line as early as possible so not many have completed the game yet.\n\n\nI have yet to figure out the \"clear x game with a bonus\" stamps and how to find Bowser's Airship and the hidden coin in the binoculars.  If anyone has tips on either of those, I would highly appreciate the help.  I spend more time than I'd like to admit up there just waiting for the binoculars to open up, but I'll touch on that later.\n\n\nToadstool Cafe had more items that weren't on the Pass Holder Preview menu.  In short, the mushroom soup was fantastic, the short rib special was disappointing for the price and wait time, and the Peach cupcake is the highest bang-for-buck of the desserts by portion size alone.  Yes, the cupcake was available before the opening day, but I ate the other two desserts during my two previews.  I don't have the stomach or time for everything all at once. ;)\n\n\nMy biggest tip to guests is simple - pay very close attention to where the queues of where you want to go ACTUALLY start.  Many guests just entering the area for the first time just hop in an ambiguous queue right down the middle of the land hoping it's for Mario Kart, but it's mostly just for the cafe or the Mario meet-up.  Take some time to look around, ask staff questions, and learn where people are going and how.  The biggest confusion points are Peach's meet-up (you have cut cut THROUGH the Goomba line to the \"Peach returns at X time\" sign, then the queue is to the right of that between the chains) and the back of the land, which is a cluster of Koopa, Bowser Jr., Mario Kart, Mario meet-up, and the Cafe.  I don't really have tips for any of those beyond paying attention, as staff will change the locations of these queues depending on the amount of people in them, but just know that Some will wind back and forth, and some are straight shots, but none ever cross to form an X shape.  Also, Mario Kart's queue is very, VERY unlikely to reach a long length outside.  Park staff will open more of Yoshi's Island if they need to fit people in the Mario Kart line, so definitely ask the park staff at the entrance of the ride where the queue really starts if you're unsure.  Like I said, many people just join a line hoping to get on Mario Kart only to find that it isn't what they wanted.\n\n\nTo park staff, because I know some of you read the subreddit and some of you may even be workers in the area, thanks so much for doing your best to please everyone.  Manning on-stage is often a thankless, tiring job even in an area so vibrant and colorful, and I want you to know your work does not go unappreciated by me.  The wait staff in the cafe I talked to yesterday was very nervous and stressed, too.  I hope people aren't giving you a hard time, and I hope you guys get enough time to take a breather in between shifts.\n\n\nHowever, if I have one suggestion for the team members, it's not even about the queues and area below, but the area above.  I'm circling back to the binoculars.  If we could have even one team member timing people and teaching people how to use them properly, things would be a lot smoother.  Right now, people have to resort to self-policing, and there are a few who overstay their welcome, dragging the queue through half the building and leading people to punch the long block so much it glitches out with the lights and sound effects.  I have yet to see a block glitch out to that extent in the land, and this is on OPENING DAY.  Like I said before, too, I'm not even sure how the binoculars work or know if my band is being registered - for the first two previews, I got the Rosalina and Pikmin stamps, but the binoculars weren't registered on my map, and I STILL have yet to find the airship or hidden coin even after beating Bowser Jr. so many times across all of my visits.  Having someone upstairs to answer questions, manage the lines, and time people in and out would help a TON if you can make it happen.  Even if you're not in management, maybe someone can bring it up to them?  I know your team is probably stretched thin as it is, but I sincerely believe one extra person can make a big difference here.\n\n\nTo end on a positive note, though, thanks to all the staff for being so helpful and kind on a stressful day, whether you were aiding in attractions, sanitation, table-serving, behind-the-scenes cooking, helping Mario and Luigi shuffle through the crowd, and all of the other helpful, often thankless jobs that go into making sure the guest experience is fun.  Thanks to all of the guests I talked to who were pleasant and happy even with the chaotic scene unfolding before them.  I even met someone who had camped out over the night and saw Miyamoto in the morning.  I hope you got a good sleep after the day was done. :)\n\n\nAnd of course, thanks to you all for reading.  I might be a mod, but I still don't know everything, and I still make mistakes (like the stroller situation yesterday, and no, strollers still aren't allowed in the area at the time of writing).  You all help me learn a lot, and I only hope that what I share helps you on your trips, too. :)",

  "text":"Was looking for a detailed post from folks who did early access leading up to today. I gathered a lot of great info here and wanted to share the details from my experience to possibly help others. Apologies it\u2019s long af. \n\n\nWent with my wife and kid (6 year old) with the goal of doing everything inside SNW as quickly as we could with time to explore the rest of the park since it was our first visit. \n\n\nWe live about 2 hours away so we drove up the night before and stayed in the Hilton near the park. We parked in the hotel\u2019s self-parking lot where our car remained the next day. \n\n\nIn the morning we walked \n10 min from the hotel to the park entrance and entered USH at 6:35. Stopped at Starbucks on the way and entered SNW at 6:54. Went to the kiosks by the entrance and picked up bands then went to Toadstool Cafe to ask about reservations. The guy inside told me they weren\u2019t taking any yet. Shortly after 7:00 there was a QR code outside the door where we could make a reservation online, so we made one for 9:00. Went to the Mario Kart ride around 7:00 and got all the way to the doors just before you receive the headgear and waited a few minutes before they said the ride was down for technical difficulties. I gave it another 10 minutes, and at 7:25 it was still down so we exited and started on the key games. This was great since we never waited more than 5 minutes for a game. Went to Bowser Jr\u2019s castle with no wait and when we walked out you could tell it was 8:00 because a giant wave of people flooded inside. We decided to do Bowser Jr again (the gold mushroom didn\u2019t register on my kid\u2019s band), eat, and then get in line for Mario Kart. When we got in line (\n9:30) the wait time was showing 210 minutes. My wife let the CM know we couldn\u2019t ride during early access due to technical difficulties. CM told her to talk to his lead, she explained again, and they gave us an Express pass to the front of the line!! She really saved our day because I hadn\u2019t thought to bring that up with a CM. After Mario Kart we did the 4th key game and left SNW at 10:30 with no intention of returning the rest of the day. We were able to make the Express line for the studio tour that comes with SNW early access just before 11:00 (has to be used by that time). \n\n\nAs we were leaving SNW the lines were enormous everywhere, especially for Toadstool Cafe. Early access is 1000% worth it. Thanks to fellow redditors here for letting me know we could get in as early as 6:30. We had a really fun time!",

  "text":"Hi all, we are looking to go on one of the Fridays towards the end of this month, beginning of next month for a one day pass.\n\n\nFor parking, should we get general or preferred, is there a big difference in walking distance?\n\n\nDoes the park get really busy on Fridays? I watched some Youtube videos, and they noted Mon-Thurs as least busy days, with weekends being most crowded, and you are wasting money if you buy Express on those days.\n\n\nAlso how does Single Rider work? Do we pay separately for that or is that a separate line?\n\n\nAnd watching videos, is it still valid to do the Lower level stuff then make our way to Upper level to in terms of getting through everything in a day?\n\n\nWe plan to do the major rides, Tram, Waterworld, and Harry Potter are probably our main 3 we want to go on (skip Simpsons if needed as videos have noted), explore the park and eat at Harry Potter.\n\n\nI also notice the Super Mario World early access, is that worth getting? If we get that, does that mean we have to go there right at opening to best experience?\n\n\nWe do plan on going right at opening, and stay till around sunset, is that enough time to explore and get through everything on General Admission or do we need Express? The timing of our weekend time should be right when other neighboring states are ending Spring Break and CA is starting theirs. \n\n\nWhat would be the most ideal sequencing of rides and places to see the whole park in one day? We do not mind missing some of the smaller\/kid rides, but want to experience all the main stuff. With how crowded SNW is, we want to get in to walk around and explore, but do not expect to buy a band to participate. \n\n\nThank you to anyone who has feedback.",

  "title":"Trip recap 3\/17",
  "text":"I went to universal on 3\/17 with myself (20s), a kid, and two older family members (50s-60s). Here\u2019s some tips and thoughts to share!! \n\n\nIf your priority is SNW, you NEED the early access. We had early access but got a late start but did make it into the world at 8:45. It took about 30 mins for parking and security, there is a special park entry line for early access. We beelined it for the ride and got off a few mins after 9. Once we got out of the ride, it was packed and so hard to get around and see things. If we had gotten there at 8, I bet we could have done the ride twice plus all of the games in that hour. \n\n\nBy 9:30 I found toadstool cafe and you have to scan the QR code to get to the reservation link and they were booking for 3:30 already. That is the only way to get into the cafe. \n\n\nOnce we booked that, we went to play the games for keys with the power band. The first game we waited about 15 mins, the second game we waited about 45 mins. The third game had a 2 hour wait so we didn\u2019t even bother. \n\n\nThe SNW ride immediately had a 120 hour wait at 9 and it got up to 220 minutes around 4-5. \n\n\nWe left the world around 10:30-11 and there were no more reservations left for the day. You can\u2019t make a reservation if you are in the park. But the toadstool cafe reservation was enough to get back in! \n\n\nOnce we came back in at 3:30, it was about an hour wait to get food. We had to wait in line to get into the building, wait in line to get to the ordering station, wait in ordering line, then wait for food. It was after 4:30 before we got our food. We had to show reservation confirmation several times and they checked our name in a system for getting a table. The menu was very limited and absolutely no substitutions. \n\n\nThe characters come out often. Mario and Luigi in one spot and peach in another. Mario and Luigi were out every hour and peach every half hour. But you NEED to be in line 30 mins ahead of time. I lined up at 4:28 for the 5PM Mario and Luigi and we were the last ones. I held spot in like while the rest of the group ate at the cafe and when I got back to the table around 5:30 there was a wait for tables and the servers were clearing our tables trying to get us out. \n\n\nWhen we got out of the cafe around 6 ish it was way cleared out. The morning rush was ridiculous. I think 8-9 and come back at 5 or 6 is the way to do it. The characters come out until 8:30 I think. \n\n\nThe park was awesome, especially for the Mario lover! I will definitely be back just for that. The game was soo cool too! \n\n\nNow some tidbits for the rest of the park: \nThere is no mobile food ordering, you literally have to just stand in line.\nMost parks I\u2019ve been to recently have mobile ordering and I don\u2019t know why they wouldn\u2019t. I would skip lines besides souvenir lines and bring food. Took about an hour waiting for lunch. \n\n\nOutside of SNW, we only did Jurassic park, studio tour, and minions mayhem. All rides were so much fun! Most lines were 60-120 mins. A worker told us out of state has spring break right now and those people who come visit leave around 6-7 and that seemed to be true. We were a slow moving group and didn\u2019t do a lot but I was happy with what we got done given our priorities and crowds and the scooter. \n\n\nWe had a member in an electric scooter and that is a nightmare in this park because there is no accessible way to get from lot to lot. She had to wait in a line about 25 people deep (around 6:30) for a shuttle that has 10 seats and takes a 20 min ride to get to the elevator to take you up to upper lot. Getting down at 8:45 AM, no problem. Getting up at 6:30 PM,took nearly an hour and a half! \n\n\nWe had a fun time and we will be back. We upgraded our tickets for season passes for $84. There\u2019s like 70% backout Saturdays but all open Jan-March and it\u2019s a 12 month pass so we will come a lot then. \n\n\nFeel free to ask any questions and I\u2019ll see if I can answer!",

  "title":"Assistance with my Universal Hollywood\/Super Nintendo World trip plan in June",
  "text":"In 10 weeks I will be visiting Universal Hollywood for the first time with a focus on Super Nintendo World with my wife and son and thought I would throw out my plan here. I already have my tickets for Sunday, June 11 including Express Passes and Super Nintendo Early Entry. This plan assumes an opening time of 8AM. And I\u2019m also an annual passholder at Orlando so I have a general understanding of how Universal tends to operate, even if I don\u2019t have any experience in California. \n\n\nMy thought is that I will arrive to the parking area (General Parking) at 6AM. This should hopefully allow me to be at the gates at 630AM preparing for the 7AM early entry. \n\n\nOnce I beeline it to Super Nintendo World, I planned on getting three Power Up bands from vending machines and hitting the three games plus Bowser Jr. first. After defeating that monster, we would get in line for Mario Kart. I\u2019d ideally like to have all of this completed prior to 8AM when general admission arrives. Does this sound possible? \n\n\nAnd where do photos with Mario\/Luigi and Peach factor in? I\u2019d like to get photos with them but not if the line is an hour each. \n\n\nAdditionally, I would like to secure a reservation to Toad\u2019s, does it make sense to do this immediately upon arrival or would any point during my early entry provide me with a reasonable return time? I understand that a reservation gets you access to the line which takes at least a half hour or more and then you order and wait for your food so I know there will be time considerations here too. \n\n\nAfter the park opens to everyone, at this point we would leave and do all the other rides and the Waterworld show with express. That should be relatively smooth sailing I would think. \n\n\nAfter we do all of that, if it\u2019s on virtual line for entry, we would use our express entry to return to Super Nintendo World and just enjoy the sights and sounds. Possibly hop into the single rider line for Mario Kart if the line is as long as I anticipate it to be. \n\n\nThen likely get dinner somewhere on citywalk and call it a night or go back in for another round in some regular lines. Thoughts from people who have been? Does this seem reasonable? Am I missing anything?",

  "title":"Half-Day Trip Notes - USH 4\/5\/23",
  "text":"Hello, everyone.\n\n\nI only stayed in the park between 8:00a and 11:30a or so, but I still thought I'd pen down a few notes for you all in case there are still some folks needing assistance with planning.\n\n\nI went into the day with a few goals in mind.  Of course, I wanted to meet a fellow Redditor, but I also wanted to get the Top 10 Score in Bowser Jr. Shadow Showdown, if possible.\n\n\nFor whatever reason, I thought the park opened at 9 today instead of 8, so I quickly Ubered my way down instead of taking public transit.  I was able to jump in line and head straight into SNW without a crowd.  The big family behind me found out the hard way that strollers weren't allowed in the land.  I got in right around 8:20 or so.\n\n\nFirst thing to note - Toadstool Cafe now has a reservation sign right next to the entrance pipe.  You don't have to walk into the land anymore to make a reservation - snap a photo as you're entering, and make your reservation while you wait for something else.  I had no intention of eating there today, though.  I won't mention the cafe again in this post, so I'll just say it was out of reservation slots by 10:00a or so.  You'd better get your slot in as soon as possible if you want to eat there.  I can recommend food I've had before, but like I said, I didn't eat there today, so I'm not sure if much has changed.\n\n\nSome might think spring break Wednesday wouldn't be as bad as spring break Saturday.  I personally think they're pretty comparable.  The main walkway in the land was still an absolute scramble as usual, with stop-and-go foot traffic.  Mario Kart's wait time hit 90 minutes posted by the time I got in.  Once I got past the main squeeze, I jumped right into Bowser Jr. Shadow Showdown and played the game using the keys I had stacked up and didn't spend on my previous visit.  I walked out after playing and found... nothing registered to the band.  I figured I'd just wait a while for it to update and do something else in the meantime, since I'm used to that happening.  Soon after, I was informed by the Redditor I was meeting that they couldn't make it, since they didn't check blackout dates on their pass and they were blacked out today, so I was on my own.\n\n\nWhile I was in Shadow Showdown, though, I noticed something - kids with two parents and one Power-Up Band were all allowed into the building.  Perhaps this staff member guarding the entrance didn't know about the two person rule or the rules have changed?  Don't plan on that happening on other visits, though - just take note of it.\n\n\nI saw Mario and Luigi were outside taking photos, and I asked about getting in line, but the staff member said the line was closed.  For the record, I'd already taken photos with Mario and Luigi before, but I hadn't gotten the stamp for it because it just never worked.  I read on this sub that you could just ask the staff member for the stamp if you needed it and have already taken photos with the bros, so I asked about that.  The staff member said that giving me the stamp without taking another photo would be possible once the whole line for photos was done, so I waited outside the closed queue for the rest of the line to snap photos, about 10-15 minutes.  After that, the staff with the scanner came up and scanned my band and the band of another guest there for the same reason.  They actually scanned our bands twice to make sure we got it, and I did, so I went on my own way.\n\n\nI noticed that even after getting Mario's and Luigi's stamps, the last pins on my map I needed to fill, I didn't get the map stamp.  I also still didn't have the Bowser Jr. score added to my leaderboard, and for whatever reason, I still had all my keys.  I asked the staff member out front about it, and she said they'd call someone over with a GAT (guest assistance tool).  I waited for maybe half an hour for the person with the GAT to arrive, but I didn't mind because I didn't have anything else to do.  About 15 minutes in, a big group of people asked about the same issue, and we waited together.\n\n\nWhen the park staff with the GAT came, I explained the situation.  The staff member told me that the leaderboard was probably down since the app showed no one on it.  I also told them about the map stamp.  They manually entered the score into the system, and they told me I was now in first (which, by default because of the leaderboard outage, was true on my side, too).  I also got the map stamp after - they said updates to the user account sometimes hit all at once after the GAT gets involved.  I thanked them and walked away.\n\n\nI decided to try my luck with Mario Kart.  I still had a couple hours until the movie, so I figured I might as well go for it.  The standby wait was 120 minutes, so I thought I'd go to single-rider until I realized... single-rider last time took nearly an hour, and most of it was just standing still in a tight, lackluster hallway.  If I waited in Mario Kart using the standard queue, I'd be waiting longer, but I'd at least have pretty stuff to look at.  I used plain standby instead.  Timing from start of wait to kart was an 80 minutes, 40 minutes LESS than the posted time.  I was floored to say the least.  I will likely be using standby for all future rides unless the single-rider is really, really short.\n\n\nI got wrecked by the kid next to me, but I still got a first place stamp?  I wondered how that works, but I'm not going to question it.  Thanks for helping, kid. :)\n\n\nAfter that, I ducked into the little side rooms by the castle to hit a few blocks.  I wasn't sure about how many more I'd need to get the 250 stamp, but I got it after punching a bunch in those rooms.  I left for the movie soon after, at 11:30p.\n\n\nAll in all, this visit was very short, but still had some great learning experiences for me.  With how close I am to completion according to my own standards (I'm not going to try for more leaderboard stamps), I don't know how much I'll be waiting in line for stuff like this anymore, but I continue to enjoy the area.\n\n\nI'm also just slightly... JUST SLIGHTLY... gearing up to go back to regular park stuff.  The shiny new thing is very much not shiny and new anymore.  I have 114\/128 stamps, and I already told myself I wasn't getting anymore.\n\n\nThanks for reading, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask away, as usual.  I hope this post helps you with your own travel plans. :)",

Even if no rides are available for the Trolls from DreamWorks and aren't planned so far, I want to see the DreamWorks Trolls at the Universal Studios. I have heard of being able to see Poppy and Guy Diamond there. \n\n\nI know that the original Trolls movie came out in 2016, but I didn't see the movie yet four years ago. Now I want to see the DreamWorks Trolls at Universal Studios and see if I can take a picture with them. \n\n\nIt's great to see now that a bus company in Fresno has an opportunity to go to the Universal Studios in July. I get excited about it, and not just see the other movies and TV shows that I have been enjoying for years now, but also the DreamWorks Trolls. I got happy when I went online like last year on the website of Universal Studios that there is a place there to see the DreamWorks Trolls. And I am not sure if I can see many of the characters of the Trolls from DreamWorks at Universal Studios. \n\n\nAnd I am so excited about Trolls Band Together coming out in November.",

  "title":"Trip Notes - USH 4\/23\/2023",
  "text":"Hello, everyone.\n\n\nToday was a big day for me - I was going with my cousins to celebrate one of their birthdays, and it was the first time I went to the park with other people in a LONG time.  Everyone else in the group hadn't been in a few years, so I was quite excited to be able to show them around, point out the changes, and bring them into Super Nintendo World for the first time.\n\n\nWe did buy Early Access, but we woke up and got on the road late, so we ended up physically in the land at around 7:20a instead of 7:00a.  However, that ended up not being a big deal anyway.  I immediately got a Toadstool Caf\u00e9 reservation for as early as possible (ended up being 10:15a), and we got to playing the games.\n\n\nThe lines for the games were, even midway through the Early Access, surprisingly short.  I hadn't seen lines that short for the games since my second Passholder Preview, and Thwomp Panel Panic in particular was a walk-on when we got to it.  I also somehow got the Piranha Plant Nap Mishap stamp with a bonus without any knowledge of how I got it.  The team member said to hit the clocks quickly.  One in the party theorized that the stamp would be earned if, at any point during the game, every clock was \"off\" at the same time after the band activated the game, but I'm still unsure.  I hope to collect more information on it soon.\n\n\nWe had finished all four minigames by 8:00a, and I got the group to go to Mario Kart immediately so we could be somewhere in the queue before the general admissions crowd got in, which ended up being the perfect read.  We were in and out in half an hour using basic standby, and the wait time spiked to 120 minutes when we got out.  However, the ride broke down mid-race, and the music was desynced for the remainder of the ride, which was unfortunate and the beginning of a concerning trend for the big rides we went on.\n\n\nWe went to Bowser Jr. after.  We were in the queue when a team member came out and said the battle was having tech issues.  We left the building, but ended up coming back soon after when it was working.  To my surprise, the amount of people per band has been expanded.  Now, FOUR people can enter Bowser Jr. Shadow Showdown with ONE band.  This was a major operations change that I think will affect many people's purchasing decisions, so that warrants a mention.  I had stocked up on keys before today, but I guess it didn't matter, since my party of four was all able to come in using my band.  At least when we actually got to the battle portion, the motion tracking was on-point.  I hit my personal best at 57 Coins and finally got the stamp for it.\n\n\nWe dilly-dallied through the little side rooms until our reservation time at Toadstool Cafe (at that point in the day, it was easier to wait out the half-hour than go out and come back in).  We ended up wrapping up our meal too late for Express Studio Tour.\n\n\nWe went on the Studio Tour straight after.  Even without Express, the wait time was only about half an hour listed, and when we got on, it was even shorter (maybe 20 minutes or so?).  The tour was great, though I did feel like there were a lot more ads this time than before (That's My Jam, the Mario movie, The Voice, and more got new shout-outs when I felt like they didn't need to).  I'm surprised they recorded new Studio Tour footage for Bel-Air, but I felt it was a bit unnecessary.  Notably, though, Fast and Furious: Supercharged was down when we went.  We had to skip the show entirely.  To make up for it, the tour driver put on \"Tramstastic Day\" (I... am not the biggest fan of the song).\n\n\nWe jumped down to the Lower Lot again because I figured some of the Lower Lot rides would be a bit easier to swallow.  I noticed on the app that Revenge of the Mummy was listed at 45 minutes, but I knew better and looked over the escalators to the line itself and knew the app just wasn't updating, so I convinced the group to go on Transformers instead, which ended up being another amazing read.  Transformers was listed at 65 minutes, but we went from queue to loaded in exactly half an hour.  Meanwhile, literally while we were in line for Transformers, we saw the Mummy app wait spike from 45 to 70 minutes.  Lesson for all - when the app shows an abnormally low wait time, people SWARM to it, which causes it to spike.  If you are close to the ride when it has a low wait time, it'll be easier to capitalize, but if you're far away, the ability for you to capitalize on it might be gone by the time you walk to the ride.  If you're unsure, look at the line and where it ends for a sure way of knowing how bad the wait is.  I ended up doing this for Jurassic Park right after Transformers, decided it was too long, and the group went back up.\n\n\nWe floated through the shops for a while before getting into Waterworld at 3:15p.  I hadn't been in a couple years, and the show was about the same as ever, which isn't a bad thing in this case.  We jumped on KFP next because it was nearby and one in my party wanted to see it, and that was also a good enough experience.\n\n\nFor me, this is when it went downhill.  We decided to go to Forbidden Journey next because I predicted that the 75 minute wait was a fluke.  Famously, Forbidden Journey doesn't have as long a wait as the Lower Lot rides in the afternoon.  As it turned out, that 75-minute wait was not a fluke - in fact, our final wait time was 90 minutes from tail of line to boarding.  It was the only bad read of the day so far on my part, but a critical one.\n\n\nWe got dinner at Three Broomsticks after riding.  Because the wait was longer than anticipated, we couldn't ride The Simpsons like we had planned to (we weren't staying in the park all day - one of my cousins has to drive down to San Diego to make his college classes on Monday), and none of the other rides seemed appealing to the group at that point in the day.  In the end, we ended up not going on any more rides after that - we wrapped up eating, did a spot of shopping at Sanrio and Popcornopolis, and headed home right before 8:00p.\n\n\nAll things considered, today was a net positive, but I was very surprised by the amount of ride breakdowns on the bigger stuff.  I didn't mention this earlier, but both Mummy and Forbidden Journey were completely down for periods of the day, which definitely threw off a bit of my planning.  Of course, three of the big rides we went on had broken elements, too, though minor overall.\n\n\nLike I said, though, the day was a net positive, and I'm glad I was able to visit and enjoy time with my family.  Hopefully, the lesson about predicting crowds and not just following the app helps some folks when they're in the park and not sure what to do.  I still don't know how to sign off these things, so happy travels, I guess. :)",

They said no.\n\n\nMy friend is allergic to mushrooms, asked if they could just not put mushrooms on the burger. Also no.\n\n\nstruck up a conversation with someone else at another table, they asked if they could get no cheese on the burger. Nope, it has to come with cheese.\n\n\nI asked for no ice with my super star boba. They said it has to come with ice. (This one I get, it\u2019s so they can give you more ice and less drink. I\u2019m still salty about it though)\n\n\nNo gluten free options for the pasta or burger buns. Only the soup and caprese salad are GF.

We were out by 7pm.\nReally wish Universal did more virtual lines but oh well.

  "text":"We got the Express Pass for 2, and it was well worth it! We got there around 9am. We headed to Super Nintendo World. We bought the Power Up Bands. We decided to get the 150 minute wait for the Mario Kart Challenge out of the way. The queue line made it feel like we were waiting for a short time. It was amazing seeing all the details. It felt like we only waited for an hour and a half at most. The ride was fun, but wish it was longer and a little faster. Rainbow road was our favorite part of the ride. We played the games around the park. We didn\u2019t get to go to Toadstool Cafe because they were fully booked. We spent a good 6 hours in the land. I loved it! I wish it was bigger because that can accommodate more people. \n\n\nWe decided to go eat, but there were such long lines everywhere for food. We ended up getting corn dogs, a churro and the refillable souvenir cup. It was good enough to fill us up. I recommend the souvenir cup because it is really worth the value! Free refills all day! We only bought one for my boyfriend and I. \n\n\nWe went on the Jurassic Ride, Transformers, Mummy, Simpsons, Studio Tour, Harry Potter and Forbidden Journey, Despicable Me, Secret Life of Pets and saw the Kung Fu Panda theatre show. We didn\u2019t get to see WaterWorld but there is always next time! My favorite ride was the Mummy overall. The launch was a big surprise for me. The Studio Tour was a great experience. Great time to rest our legs. We had awesome tour guides and the group vibe was lively and energetic. Everyone was having the time of their lives during King Kong lol. \n\n\nWe ended our day by eating food I don\u2019t recommend which was the ramen and teriyaki bowls. Very lack luster. We do recommend the funnel cake. Very good! \n\n\nOverall, a great day! :) We can\u2019t wait to go back for Halloween Horror Nights! \n\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions!",

  "title":"Wizarding World expansion thought",
  "text":"Today a thought struck me. We know Diagon Alley is located within the London area of USF, wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to build the Ministry of Magic ride being built at Epic Universe there instead. I know space is an issue but hear me out. I know I\u2019m going to get slaughtered for this, but what if it replaced MIB and Fear Factor. It should be enough space and it would expand the London area of the park. I like MIB to but we are getting a new shooting ride with Minion Blast. It probably won\u2019t be as good but it still makes sense. And it would be an world class attraction replacing MIB.\n\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about what would be at Epic Universe. I would add a dark ride based on Fantastic Beasts, using the same ride system as Transformers 3D and the Adventures of Spider-Man. The queue would go through Newt\u2019s suitcase. You would encounter different animatronic beasts during the queue. The ride itself would be based loosely on the story of the first FB film. You hunt down the beasts that escaped from Newt\u2019s suitcase and catch them. In the land that would be themed to wizarding New York you would have Jacob Kowalski\u2019s bakery and that bar they visit in the movie. You could also have one or two supporting attractions being a show, MACUSA themed attraction or a coaster of sorts. Or you just make walking through Newt\u2019s suitcase a whole attraction, like multiple Raptor encounter on steroids.\n\n\nWhat do you think about this idea? I know they started building and there is no going back. But wouldn\u2019t it have been better if they did it this way?",

  "title":"My Recent Visit - Honest Opinion",
  "text":"This past Monday, May 1, 2023, my husband and I brought our two sons (aged 12 and 5) to Universal Studios Hollywood. As SoCal residents, we typically visit USH once or twice a year as a family to get our theme park fix (my husband is not a Disneyland fan and I don\u2019t like the genie system, so we only go to Disney maybe once every 3 years). \n\n\nWe\u2019ve been so excited for the opening of Super Nintendo World, because we are all avid Mario Bros fans. We didn\u2019t want to visit right when SNW opened in February because we knew the crowds would be insane. We waited as long as we could and decided that now was a good time to visit.\n\n\nWe purchased 4 express passes, like we normally do, but this time we added on the $25 per person Early Entry tickets so we would be able to ride Mario Kart at least once before the crowds came and the line got too long (Express Pass cannot be used on Mario Kart). As soon as we entered the park, we paid over $80 for 2 Power Up Bands for our sons (we figured not all 4 of us would need one) and we went straight away to Mario Kart. The line moved very quickly until we reached the first holding area where we stood huddled up in a closed room of probably 80 people for about 10 minutes. Then we were all let loose into another area where we had to fight the crowd to reach the window where we picked up our visors. We finally got to ride MK after a total of about 30 minutes waiting from the time we entered the line. Three of us agreed that it was fun to have something new in the park, but the ride wasn\u2019t spectacular. It definitely wasn\u2019t worth waiting 150 minutes to ride again (which was the wait time when we got out). My 5 year was extremely disappointed that we couldn\u2019t ride again, but we convinced home that there was more fun to be had in SNW!!\n\n\nWe then planned to do all three mini games so we could get the three keys needed to enter Bowser Jr\u2019s lair. We waited about 15 minutes to play the first game and both our boys got to play and get their first key. We went to the next game and the line was extremely long, but we decided to wait anyway \u2013 we wanted the full SNW experience! After about 20 minutes of waiting in a line that didn\u2019t seem to be moving much we realized the problem\u2026 each person with a band takes a turn that\u2019s roughly 30 seconds long and there had to be over 100 people people in front of us and ALMOST ALL of them had bands! Not just the kids! Almost everyone! In fact, there was a group of 9 adults directly in front of us in line (no kids in their group) and 8 out of 9 of them had bands! So after about an hour of waiting, it was finally my sons\u2019 turn. I helped our 5-year-old win and we got his 2nd key. Our 12-year-old played on his own, but couldn\u2019t get the timing right and lost. That\u2019s when we found out that YOU DON\u2019T GET A KEY WIN OR LOSE \u2013 you only get a key if you win!! So after all of that waiting, my son didn\u2019t even get a key! Thankfully, 4 people can get into Bowser Jr\u2019s lair on just one band with 3 keys, but by the time we finished playing the second mini game, SNW was completely overrun because the park was open to everyone by that time. We decided to give up on waiting to ply another mini game and give up on SNW altogether and enjoy the rest of the park as we usually would.\n\n\nWe bought some lunch that was somewhere between mediocre and just plain bad (we knew to expect this from past visits and wish USH would let you bring in outside food or up the quality of food inside the park). Then we rode all of the other rides (except HP & the Forbidden Journey because the 3 of us that could ride agreed that it made us all sick last visit) and did King Fu Panda and the Studio Tour. We attended the Water World show for the first time ever and it was SOOOO GOOD!! It was absolutely the highlight of our visit.\n\n\nWe decided to give SNW one last attempt before we left since we really do LOVE Mario and really wanted to play Boswer Jr\u2019s shadow game. We waited another 40 minutes to play the last mini-game which we could play as a team and we won! We had the last key we needed to get into BJ\u2019s lair!! The wait for BJ\u2019s lair was not long (since most of the waiting happens just trying to get the keys) and the game was pretty fun!! We were happy we came back and were able to complete the mini games and visit some \u201csecret\u201d spots to rack up some points.\n\n\nAll-in-all, we made the most of the day (we were in park from 8am to about 7pm), but there are so many things that should have gone better. It\u2019s been over a month since SNW opened and there has to be more done to make it a great family experience.Some suggestions:\n1.\tAllow multiple bands to receive a key for one go-round on a mini game. For example, if there is a party of 4, swipe all 4 bands at once \u2013 if the first person in the party wins \u2013 everyone gets a key. If the first person loses, the second person get to try and hopefully wins a key for the whole party and then no one else has to go and the line keeps moving.\n2.\tGive some priority to kids \u2013 this one may seem unfair, but it\u2019s completely heartbreaking to have small kids waiting in line for hours behind grown adults who can each afford a Power Up Band. Maybe let 3 kids play, then 1 adult, then 3 kids, and so on\n3.\tHave the USH team member HELP move things along by helping the players win (give tips on how and when to hit the POW block, help hit alarm clocks, help spin the Goomba\u2026 something!)\n4.\tGive more structure to the Mario Kart Line \u2013 about 40 people who were BEHIND us in line, ended up in front of us because they were telling each other to \u201cpush forward, push forward\u201d with no regard for how dangerous that is in a small space with that many people. I had to pick up my 5-year-old and hold him for part of the time because I was worried he might get trampled! The Mario Kart queue is absolutely NOT SAFE the way it is now. Add some line separation the entire way! \n\n\nMy point is that USH needs to work to get people in and out of SNW by creating efficiencies within SNW. Most people want to experience it all, but spending 6 hours (2.5 for MK, 3 for mini games, 0.5 for BJ\u2019s lair - not counting exploring the land) to do it all makes no sense.\n\n\nThis trip we spent $1,376 on Express Passes, Early Entry tickets, Front Gate Parking, Power Up Bands, All Day Picture Pass (which only worked on 4 rides that day), food\/snacks, and souvenirs within the park. I know it\u2019s a theme park and there is going to be some frustration with lines and crowds of people, but when I\u2019m spending that much money for my small family to have a WONDERFUL experience, I would expect that the park do their best to make our experience enjoyable and we didn\u2019t feel like USH held up their end. They take everyone\u2019s money and don\u2019t provide an experience worth the cost. Be SAFE, create EFFICIENCIES, provide QUALITY. Sadly, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be back this year.",

It\u2019s not unheard of that folks are not interested in the theme park part of the tour (as you already have unlimited fast pass to all rides). So basically the tour is not required and you have unlimited access anyway to all rides prior\/during\/after the tour (including Mario).

No early access ticket, though.\n\n\nWe should be at the park entrance when opening (seems to be the advice with what i saw on the internet).

The walk from the entrance to the lower lot is about 10 min. When we went to Bowsers Challenge, it was already a 30 min wait. \n\n\n\n\nthe ride had several technical difficulties throughout the wait which pushed the wait to be about an hour. once we came off, the wait was about two hours.\n\n\n\n\n8:00-8:30 : We browsed around, looked around the park and got our power up bands. The challenges around the park were crowded as well. The park is small but there\u2019s a small balcony where you can see the overview of the park. \n\n\n8:30-10:30 : Rode Jurassic World and the Mummy. The wait times were each 30 min and we were able to hit all of those pretty fast! They are right out of Nintendo World so it was good. \n\n\n10:30-12:00 : Browsed around the park, snack breaks, looked at the stores and met up with the rest of our group. \n\n\n12:00-2:00 : We went back to SNW and by this time there was a huge crowd getting virtual queue reservations and coming in. We were able to get in with our Toadstool Cafe reservations. \n\n\n\n\nI booked our reservation at 12:30 but we weren\u2019t able to order until 1:00.

The refillable cup was about to sell out as well. \n\n\n\n\nEdit : Our group was 10 but we were able to sit next to booths next to each other! I booked it 5 + 5. They were actually accommodating with that. \n\n\n\n\nWhat we ordered : \nThe Luigi burger was delicious with the pesto sauce. The Mario burger is much bigger than the Luigi burger just an FYI. I\u2019d say the peach cupcake was the best dessert there. The tiramisu block was underwhelming since a lot of it was with cool whip or whip cream. The popping Boba was so good! All of these items were reasonably priced and it was perfect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:00-5:00 : We ended off the day with the studio tour and harry potter rides. The wait times started to die down and it wasn\u2019t busy at all here. \n\n\nI\u2019d like to thank this subreddit for helping me organize and give out tips for the park. I was able to successfully plan this day well!",

  "title":"Trip report, first timers Sun May 21",
  "text":"Thanks to this sub we had a great first trip and were able to get in nearly everything for our first trip to USH!\n\n\n\n\nbought express passes for family and early access for SNW. Don't know that I'd go all out for every trip like this one, but it was definitely worth it on this busy Sunday.\n\n\n\n\nwoke up early and took shuttle up the hill near our hotel to make it into the park at 705. Joined a few hundred other guests in SNW and got right to work on collecting coins and stamps.  Waited in line for Bowser about 25 mins before loading, would have been less time but they were having technical problems. After the ride it was open to everyone and predictably packed but still managed to do some more things.\n\n\n\n\nmanaged to get reservations for Toadstool at 11 (thanks to this sub \ud83d\ude4c) and so we did the rest of LL attractions to kill time. Toadstool was decent for the price and a nice retreat from the craziness outside.\n\n\n\n\nkid was just barely height for Mummy and wanted to go, guy working the front promised him it was not scary at all, but the ride may have scarred him for life?! Sorry buddy \ud83d\ude2c\n\n\n\n\nmy must do ride was Jurassic world and it did not disappoint. We also enjoyed the dino play area for getting the post Mummy anxiety worked out lol.\n\n\n\n\nI am not a huge fan of projection rides which meant I was in for a woozy but still fun time the rest of the day. \n\n\n\n\nstray observations: lots of people making out that day, like how do you even manage on the Simpsons ride without accidentally biting a tongue off \ud83e\udd14. I'm talking 30 and 40yos going full on. My kid was fascinated and learned a lot this day \ud83d\ude05.\n\n\n\n\nfuck jk Rowling still but Harry Potter world was amazing and we loved everything in it. Kid loved both rides and was grateful to be able to just make height for Journey. \n\n\n\n\nwe took a break in the afternoon and recharged for a return after crowds and temps cooled. Finished all the UL rides we hadn't made it to, really enjoyed minions area.\n\n\n\n\nwe never made it back to SNW because no reservations and just the hassle of it. Kid was devastated bc he missed out on a stamp by losing the interactive challenge so we didn't get to do Bowser Jr thing. I don't love the state of this area right now, it's too crowded and chaotic for me to enjoy personally. I got full on bodied by chuckleheads sweeping their cell phones around for pano views, punched in the face by someone striking a pose, and did not enjoy waiting in line 5x in a row for a rushed experience. Still love the land and design, will return later.",

  "text":"Expensive yes. worth it?  Almost.\n\n\nArrived for 8:30 start.  Lounge was nice, plenty of seating and space.\n\n\nBreakfast foods were the worst food in the park.  Cold croissants and cold, obviously store bought pastries.\n\n\nTour guide experience was amazing.  Friendly and knowledgeable guide, good timing to maximize rides and showtimes.\n\n\nLunch at Moulin Rouge was shockingly good. Partner and I were both surprised just how good almost every single menu item was.\n\n\nBeing able to come and go through SNW was an unexpected bonus.\n\n\nMany of the rides had a separate VIP line beyond the express line for even faster entrance - another unexpected bonus.\n\n\nWe managed to experience every attraction in our day though we did stay from open to close.  Longest line wait was unsurprisingly Mario Kart due to the double room lock-in.  Beyond that, never waited more than 2-3 minutes to get on a ride.\n\n\nWait times for the key games at SNW were all about 30min, not too bad and plenty of decorations and eye candy to keep us entertained for the waits.  \n\n\nThe \nonly\n disappointment of the day was not being able to get a reservation at Toadstool cafe.  The way the tour was organized we didn\u2019t get the SNW until about 2pm and they didn\u2019t prebook us a time, and the staff said there was no gaming the system.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\nSummary - if you hate waiting in queues to the point it ruins your day, and you can afford it, VIP really is just that.  \n\n\nJust tell your guide first thing in the morning to book you an appointment at Toadstool Cafe, it\u2019s the one thing in the park not accounted for in the VIP experience (yet).",

How exactly does this work for someone like me who bought an Express ticket? Also, I was interested in some of the Mario merch, more specifically to see if they sold Mario and Luigi hats, but have not seen videos that show those 2 hats. Do they sell them, and if not, what are the hats they sell over at the park?",

On the topic of Megathreads and coverage, I have updated the SNW Megathread today with a tiny handful of new bits of information and a touch of clarity in the murky parts.  However, I'm sure there are more improvements that could be made.  If you'd like to help improve the Megathread, please let me know what else should be added or updated that the general guests might not know about.  I will continue to update things on my own as I see fit, but I still want help from the community to suit everyone's needs.\n\n\nImportantly, as you probably already figured out, I want the Megathread main post to only contain flat information.  I don't put strategies in the main post.  The intention is to build a tool to help with planning, but not necessarily BE the planner.  Of course strategies can still be discussed in the replies. :)\n\n\nEven though the land is a few months old now, I plan to keep it pinned until early next year at least.  Many guests are waiting for summer vacation to go, and even more might be anticipating tickets as holiday gifts.  There will be many newcomers this year, and I want to be sure the information reaches everyone so everyone can have a good time.\n\n\nThanks in advance. :)\n\n\nThe FAQ\/Megathread can be found here.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/universalstudios\/comments\/zqhbb6\/faqmegathread_super_nintendo_world_universal\/",

  "title":"Lessons from Universal Hollywood Wed 5\/24",
  "text":"Wednesday 5\/24 wasn\u2019t very busy and I shouldn\u2019t have purchased Universal Express.     \n\n\nSpend the extra for Preferred Parking. It was literally a 5-min walk and SO worth it.     \n\n\nSuper Nintendo World: pretty cool but a small area. Only 1 ride. Yes there are the mini games but my kids didn\u2019t find them that engaging.     \n\n\nPower-Up Band: cool looking but IMO not worth the $40\/each. Bands used to collect coins from interactive Coin Blocks, find secret images hidden in the land, etc. Although designed to make it a more immersive experience, my kids didn\u2019t find them to be that cool. Pass and buy a shirt or plushy. \nYou can still do the mini games\n.    \n\n\nToadstool Cafe Reservation: Used the Reddit posted link to make a reservation for 11:30am. Link didn\u2019t show any openings at midnight Pacific time, and only became live around 7:00am. Made the reservation at 7:45am the day of (almost all day was open for 4 people at 7:45am). By 10:00am, all reservations were gone.     \n\n\nToadstool Cafe Experience: Semi-cool experience eating in SNW but overall was not that exciting. Environment was nice but nothing very entertaining. Food wasn\u2019t great. Burgers and fries came out warm-ish but boarder line room temp. Maybe I expected too much but food was school lunch cafeteria quality.     \n\n\nMario Kart Ride: Wait times varied between 45-75 min with the average being 60 min. Waiting in line was enjoyable because of the castle exhibits. Ride itself was fun. We all liked how they used the visor to make the ride interactive. The only negative is the visor keeps you from focusing on the ride decorations (because you\u2019re shooting the visor characters). If they had the space, a Mario Kart ride designed like Disney\u2019s Cars would have been perfect.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the kids were excited to visit SNW and it was worth the price of every.    \n\n\nEdit: may need the power band to play mini games.",

  "title":"FAQ\/MEGATHREAD - Minion Land @ Universal Studios Florida",
  "text":"Hello, everyone.  Please feel free to reply to this post with questions,  meet-up requests, or anything else related to Minion Land at  Universal Studios Florida.  I will provide helpful links and information in this main post that will be updated as more information is released and verified.\n\n\nAs requested by you all, this will be a light megathread.  We won't go as in-depth here as we did for Super Nintendo World at USH, but we also still hope you'll be able to make more informed travel decisions by reading the main post here or asking questions below it.\n\n\nIf there's something you'd like us to cover in this area that we haven't yet or if we missed a detail on something we've already covered, please reply to this post or send us a ModMail with that information.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nLand Overview\n\n\nMinion Land\n is a soon-to-be-open area inside the Universal Studios Florida (USF) theme park, which itself is a park inside the Universal Orlando Resort (UOR).  It consists of two attractions (Illumination's Villain-Con Minion Blast and Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem), four dining locations (Minion Cafe, Bake My Day, Pop-A-Nana, and Freeze Ray Pops), two merchandise shops (Evil Stuff and Super Silly Stuff), and a meet-and-greet area (Illumination Theater).\n\n\nNote that Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem and Super Silly Stuff are already open at Universal Studios Florida.  The UOR website still lists them as part of the area, however.\n\n\nUniversal Destinations and Experiences has yet to provide opening dates and admission details for this new area.  It is still slated for a summer 2023 opening, but please keep checking back for further updates and specifications.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nDespicable Me: Minion Mayhem\n\n\nDespicable Me: Minion Mayhem\n is a simulator attraction themed to the Despicable Me franchise.  \nIt is already open\n at USF.\n\n\nGuests are welcomed into Gru's house to be turned into Minions to work for him.  Gru's three adopted daughters, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, are tasked by Gru to train the guests ahead of their new careers.  Guests are visiting on the anniversary of the girls' adoption, and though Agnes has a gift for Gru, he is too preoccupied with villainy to accept it.  After being shrunken down and turned into Minions, guests are taken through Gru's hideout and wacky Minions-invovled hijinks ensue.\n\n\nAll guests must be at least 48\" tall to ride on their own and at least 40\" tall to ride at all.  Guests between 40\" and 48\" tall must ride together with someone at least 48\" or taller.\n\n\nThis attraction is compatible with all Express Pass types.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nIllumination's Villain-Con Minion Blast\n\n\nIllumination's Villain-Con Minion Blast is a yet-to-be-opened attraction themed to the Minions franchise.  It is slated to open sometime in summer 2023 alongside the rest of Minion Land.  It is located in the former site of the Shrek 4D attraction.\n\n\nWhile not much is known about the attraction (it isn't yet open anywhere else in the world), the \nkey art\n depicts guests standing up and using light guns.  We expect this to be a gallery arcade shooter, potentially with dark ride elements.  Please check back in the future for further details.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nDining Options\n\n\nAll four dining locations are slated to open in summer 2023 alongside the rest of Minion Land.\n\n\nMinion Cafe\n will be the main dining option.  Looking at the key art, we are not sure if it is a QSR or sit-down or hybrid.  The menu is also not known, but we expect it to have a similar menu to the Minion Cafe in Universal Studios Hollywood.  That menu can be found \nhere\n in full, but in short, it mainly consists of American food involving cheese, like mac and cheese, grilled cheese sandwiches, and loaded nachos with chicken (which are covered in cheese).\n\n\nBake My Day, from the \nkey art\n, appears to be a QSR serving baked goods.  Nothing else is known about the location, but we will post the menu when it is available.\n\n\nFreeze Ray Pops and Pop-A-Nana don't have concept art viewable by the public.  We presume the former will sell ice cream or frozen treats and the latter will sell popcorn.  As with the other dining options, we will post their menus when available.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nThe information for this post at the time of writing comes from the main page on the land on UOR's website, which can be found here: \nhttps:\/\/www.universalorlando.com\/web\/en\/us\/universal-studios-florida\/lands\/minion-land",

  "title":"USJ: Requesting plan to best work around a Klook schedule",
  "text":"We bought \"Express Pass 4\"'s for our upcoming trip to USJ. Klook put Harry Potter entry at 15:50, which is 2.5 hours after SMW (13:20). Our priority is Mario, so we'd like to push back the Harry Potter entry as much as we can get away with. We can even abandon Harry Potter entry if we have to, so that's an easy solution to have as much Mario time as we want, but I'm hoping for ideas on how we can do both.\n\n\nIn USJ, how much time would we need for: \n\n\n\n\nMario Kart (using the express pass)\n\n\nYoshi\n\n\nKinopio's Cafe \n\n\nComplete the power band challenges (or that's an endless quest, how long until you felt you got your money's worth out of the band)\n\n\nPhoto with Mario and\/or Luigi (optional, but very highly desired)\n\n\nVisit a shop (optional, not that important)\n\n\n\n\nThe express pass from Klook only lists a single time for area entry, but not a range. Do we need to be at the area early? Can we be late (if so, how late can we be)? Will there be a line to enter? Curious how much wiggle room there is on area entry, and any advice in that. For example, could we show up at the Harry Potter area 45 minutes late and still get into the area (followed by a mad dash to Forbidden Journey)? \n\n\nWhen using the express pass, do you activate it as you get into line or later? If we show up at the ride 5 minutes before the end of the range are we still going to be okay? \n\n\nWe have the area entry\/express pass on paper (QR code). Do we have to associate that with the app or can we leave it separate? I'm hoping we can use the app to request a Mario entry (so that we'd potentially end up with 2 entries, app and paper), so that way we might not have to abandon HP entry. Could we also request a Harry Potter entry as well as Mario, or can you only do one? Then if the new HP time is more reasonable the problem would be solved.\n\n\nThanks for any ideas on how to make this work!",

  "title":"Thoughts on Earthquake's Extensive Refurb",
  "text":"So as some of you may be aware, the iconic classic on the backlot tram tour has been closed for a roughly year long refurb. This obviously seems to be more than the usual routine maintenance. I last rode it a week ago on the 3rd and about 85% of the effects were running properly.\n\n\nWith that being said, there are some things I wish the park changes and or upgrades to the ride itself, as well as other things they should leave alone as well. \n\n\n1.Something they should leave in my opinion is the exterior paint scheme of the building. This is because at this point in time, I'm almost 100% sure that Stage 50 is one of the last remaining soundstages on the entire property to still sport the classic brown and gray scheme. Most others have been repainted into the white and gray \"Peacock\" scheme.\n\n\n\n\nWith the large scale nature of the effects, Earthquake is a ride that I believe achieves peak guest impressions when the tour guides let the ride speak for itself, rather than speak for it. In essence, it would be greatly appreciated if the guides would MUTE themselves when the ride begins. I've lost count of the number of times that I have become fed up of hearing some cheap jokes, puns, and stupid ramblings. \n\n\n\n\nWith the times changing, the film equipment and hot set decor on the platform has grown to become a massive eyesore. It's cheesy, outdated, and out of place. I genuinely wouldn't mind them removing this clutter from the area and restoring it to make it look like a genuine subway station like it was back in 1989. Aditionally, some repainting probably wouldn't hurt either. I've noticed that there seems to be grime or mold growing along the flood stairs too. Hopefully they correct this.\n\n\n\n\nFix the electrical effects such as the falling power line and station transformer. Nothing beats the sound of live electricity sparking and cracking mere feet away from the safety of your tram. The falling power line hasn't been functioning since 2021, I hope they're able to fix this sooner than later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's all for my list of changes that they should do to the ride. What do you guys think? I'm curious to hear what others think.",

  "title":"Weight\/sizing restrictions at Universal Studios Hollywood?",
  "text":"Hi, I\u2019m thinking about going to Universal Studios Hollywood and just wondering if I\u2019m not going to be allowed on any rides. I\u2019m female, 5\u20195, 200 pounds. I\u2019d say I\u2019m fairly proportional, but I do carry a lot of the weight in my stomach. But it\u2019s squishy fat, so that might work in my favor?\n\n\nI see that there are some rides that recommend people try the tester seats if their waists are greater than 40 inches. My waist is 37 inches but the largest part of my stomach is 43. Should I be worried about the 43 inches? What rides should I be worried about not fitting on?\n\n\nSecond question: what rides might be difficult for a woman who\u2019s 5\u20195, maybe 225 pounds, and very busty?\n\n\nThird question: what rides might be difficult for a man who\u2019s 5\u20198, maybe 190 pounds, and carries all his weight in his stomach, but it\u2019s a beer belly so not squishy fat?\n\n\nI told my family I wanted to go, but now I\u2019m getting really nervous that I\u2019m not going to fit and they\u2019ll escort me off.
